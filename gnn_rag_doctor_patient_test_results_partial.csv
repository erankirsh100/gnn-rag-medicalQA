 As this discomfort happens in the knee joint due to factors like the weakness of the muscles, reduced joint space, maltracking of the patella, ligament sprain etc.
 I will advise you to undergo knee rehabilitation exercises which will help you regain the full functions of the knee. Exercises like - static Quadriceps, static hamstring, straight leg raise, ankle toe movements, hip muscle strengthening, balance board training.
 This rehab plan will help you regain full functions of the muscles of the knee and reduce pains.

 In my opinion, I believe if your sensation is not palpable then it could be due to contractions of gall bladder wall due to the presence of the stones.

Is throbbing sensation normal after a tooth extraction? Hi I had a tooth extracted Wednesday just gone as I had an abcess. The dentist had trouble taking it out as was very painful. Anyway it’s now been 4days and is throbbing but not painful just niggly. I amNot sure if I have an infection or if it’s just the healing process," Hi.
 Thanks for the query.
 Well, as it is 4 days, some throbbing and slight pain is not abnormal.
As the tooth was already infected, therefore it can take a bit longer to heal completely.
Do not worry as you do not have pain so some throbbing is not abnormal and will get better in another 2-3 days.
You should continue taking antibiotics and painkillers for 3 days more for healing to get faster.
Take soft meals and avoid food particles to accumulate in extraction site.
 Hope this helps

I m just wondering how long he will have to linger in the state of partial vegetation......can t walk without assistance, doesn t want to eat much. Acting weirder by the day, mean to me, delusional. How much longer does he and family have to suffer? Doc that put him in hospice said days but now I m hearing weeks, even months."," Hi,
 .
 I understand your concern. Cancer not only affects patient, but family and close relatives also suffer. It looks like your husband has stage iv cancer with metastasis and he is in his final stages. 
 I am sorry, that you and your family have to suffer through the pain. However it would not be possible to clearly predict the expectancy in any state. 
 In my clinical experience, having associated with a few oncology cases, in similar cases, patients do not survive for more than a few week to a month. Discuss with your doctor to ensure his condition and suffering improves with adequate medication and supportive measures.
 I am sorry for this situation and I hope you and your family are able to bear with it.
 Wishes and Prayers","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 96, 'clinical_accuracy': 19, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 9, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 87, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 9}"
"Suffering form lumbar disc reherniation Hi there. I had surgery for a 2 cm disc herniation end Nov 2010. This caused problems down to S5. I lost feeling in left leg and would fall. Needed emergency surg. In was feeling better after surgery, except pain in upper back. MRI revealed small centralndisc protrusion c6/7. For the past couple of weeks have had really bad pains again in left calf, numbness , falling, dizziness ,nausea ( I do not eat well due to this however I am really overweight), and recently last week or so I am having trouble with bowel movement . I feel like I really have to unload and I have some small stringy movement or very loose mucusy movement. I noticed I am leaking a bit of urine too and feel I cannot empty,but always want to go.? Pain still in lower back. I am a 39 yr old female who also underwent an extensive abdominal surgery in Oct 2010 due to adhesive disease, huge cystic ovaries that were adhered to bowel and bladder on left side and on my right the appendix was wrapped around my cystic ovary and adhered to the abdominal wall. All was removed . Hysterectomy of uterus and tubes in April 2010. Could I have reherniatednand have cauda equina syndrome?"," Hello there..
welcome to healthcare Magic forum..
Cuada Equina usually presents with following symptoms..
1)Low back pain
2)Pain in one leg (unilateral) or both legs (bilateral) that starts in the buttocks and travels down the back of the thighs and legs (sciatica)
3)Numbness in the groin or area of contact if sitting on a saddle (perineal or saddle paresthesia)
4)Bowel and bladder disturbances
5)Lower extremity muscle weakness and loss of sensations.
Since you have more than one of these symptoms you could have re-herniated. So I would suggest you to consult a neurlogist immediately and get CT AND MRI scans done which would help you with further management!!
Hope this helps!!
Take care!!","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

What causes high ketone and high leukocyte count in children? Hi my daughter (aged 4) has high ketone and also high leukocyte count in her urine. She has been vomiting for the last 3-4 weeks but had been unwell alot before this..on and off antibiotics. Recently she has also had diarrhoea along with vomiting...what could be causing all of this.?," Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns. Her ketones are not cause to be very worried,because it was due her UTI(pyelonephritis).

"What does Encephalomalacia anteriorly in inferior aspect of both frontal lobes mean? I am awaiting a GP appointment to interpret the following MRI scan results, but would appreciate a translation/interpretation if possible; encephalomalacia anteriorly in the inferior aspect of both frontal lobes adjacent to the midline with resultant expansion of the overlying csf space and some high signal change in the underlying subcortial white matter. there is no mass effect or evidence of restricted diffusion. appearance elsewhere are unremarkable. presumably these are a sequelae of the previous head injury and results of bilateral frontal contusions. The previous head injury referred to was over 40yrs ago and has had no impact (that I am aware of! lol) on my mental or physical functioning."," Hi,Thanks for writing in.You might be one of the lucky few who had a serious head injury at a younger age and have recovered without any residual symptoms. Encephalomalacia means softening of the brain. This happens when there is injury to the brain and absent blood supply and consequently resulting in loss of brain matter and cerebrospinal fluid occupies the area after the shrinkage of that part of the brain. Since it has happened more than 40 years ago and you might have been much younger at that time, the brain circuits that were damaged were realigned and your affected brain was compensated for its loss in functions. At a young age the brain learns to cope up with its limitations in a better way. This is called neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity allows the neurons (nerve cells) in the brain to compensate for injury and disease and to adjust their activities in response to new situations or to changes in their environment.

"Experiencing bruised feel & ache around the thoracic spine & over T12 Three and a Half months ago I awoke to find my back feeling bruised over my Thoracic spine. The pain was localized over T12. It seemed to be aggravated and hurt to touch over that area. Activity or sitting for long periods in a car aggravated it and caused a raidiating burning sensation that woul go away with rest. However the bruised feeling over T12 remained constant and consistent. I went to a spine Dr. and he gave me a Prednisone shot, which helped for a month. Now the bruise like ache has returned. I have had x-rays and nothing seems out of alignment. Could this be a Spinousw Process fracture? Could it be an injury from lifting leg wieghts? What do you suggest to prevent me having to endure this the rest of my life? Please HELP. Thank You, Desperately Needing Answers"," Hello,
 With history, it appears the pain is localized in the T12 region. That is the junction which gets more muscle weakness due to abnormal posture.
  During the time having weak muscles any exercise done for the lower limbs will provide a strain there. 
 As this is the biomechanics of the spine. Leg goes up and spine goes down.
  If any weakness present there will be inflammation.
  Also, while sitting in the wrong posture, usually the relaxed position where the spine bends forward there will be over stretching of the paraspinal muscles which over a period of time goes weak and any strain applied to lower limb exercises will lead to pain there.
 As the X-ray turned out to be normal I do not suspect any kind of bone fracture there. If it was a fracture the symptoms would have been different. 
 Now there is burning sensation which is radiating in nature taking an MRI will be on a safer side to know any soft tissue injury. 
 Now coming to the stabilizing part of the spinal column. Why don't you try doing spinal extension and core stability exercise initially. Using ice packs over the painful area will reduce the pain as well. 
 Having good stability of the spine will consist of the stability and strength of the para spinal muscles along with the posture correction will help with great benefits.
 In my clinical practice of over 12 years, most cases have been reported with the same complaints. 
 Having doing correction of posture and core stability exercises have provided good outcome score. Will recommend you the same.

So you had a moderate to severe allergic reaction and even though you mention at the start you have no food allergies - which usually means 'never' - you say you had egg allergy.
You definitely need skin prick test against the common food panel - peanut, cashewnut (if you had a reaction), fish (sardine/cod), shrimp, crab, lobster and aeroallergen such as house dust mite.
Or a specific IgE blood test against the above to understand why you reacted.
You can get over egg allergy (at least 75%-80% do by age 5 years), but you retain the susceptibility of 'food allergy' only to become allergic to a specific food later.
You must keep an anaphylaxis kit with cetirizine , epipen, steroids and dial the emergency number if you get in trouble again.

 Tendonitis is basically inflammation of the area where the tendon is attached to the body. So you need to do a contrast bath, apply Gabapentin gel and exercise that particular area which you haven't mentioned.

"What causes tingling feet and legs and painful joints? Hello. I had glandular fever last Nov/Dec time and I have been left with tingling feet legs hands arms finger tips. Mainly my left side. I had blood tests in February and September this year to rule out diabetes anemia,  full blood count and liver kidney function and thyroid.  Both sets came back normal. I slipped a disk in lower back in June and I am still having some physio as it is still not 100%. My doctors and physio have said that the tingling and aching sometimes painful joints are a result of the above. I still worry.  Thank you. Sarah"," Yes,The tingling, aching and painful joints are due to slipped disc in low back. It will take some time to recede as a slipped disc can't be brought back to its normal position conservatively.

"Is leg itching, broken veins, swollen calves due to Factor V? Hi, my mother has factor v leiden and I m wondering i should be concerned and get my symptoms checked out. I get extreme itching on my legs then will see busted blood veins that turn into large bruises, quite often. Then when I sit down..for just merely a few minutes my calves will swell and or my legs fall asleep, I m constantly changing sitting positions as I do sit a lot at the computer. I need to mention also that when I ve traveled, my calves swell up and I have to prop them up for a time then the swelling goes away. I dont exercise per say regularly but i do go on walks with our dogs, and im not Always sitting down, I do run around and get up and move quite often, I do yard work and basic things around the house, i go grocery shopping and other things so I do walk often. But when I sit down, i have to change my seating arrangement within like 15mins or so or else my legs can fall asleep, even if im sitting on the couch or in a chair at dinner or even in the car, i have to prop my legs quite often. Should i get this checked out or is this considered normal ? Its been like this since i was 15 or so and I am now 34. thank you for your time and God bless you ~J.P."," Hello and welcome to HCM,
Factor V deficeincy is coagulation disorder and is associated with spontanaeous bleeding.
Spontanaeous bleeding is responsible for frequent bruising and formation of petechiae.
However, busted veins, swelling of legs and itching do not appear to be due to factor V deficiency.
These symptoms infact appear to be due to varicose veins.
A clinical assessment of the lesions is required for clinical assessment, relevant investigations and thus treatment.
 Thanks and take care

 Thank you for posting your query.
 I can assure you that your symptoms are not due to Alzheimer's disease.
 However, we should exclude a diagnosis of transient ischemic attack (TIA), in which the blood flow to brain is reduced for a while, leading to various symptoms, as you have described.
 You should consult a neurologist, get a brain scan done, and get screened for risk factors such as diabetes, high BP, cholesterol, etc.
 I hope it helps.

I would also add montelukast & levocetirizine orally.First of all, in case of allergic keratoconjunctivitis, there is abnormality in structure of eye. So please don't worry about build up of her eye.

For that I would suggest to consult an Allergist-Immunologist who will advice her some allergy testing and identify the cause.Allergic keratoconjunctivitis is usually due to an allergic reaction to air-borne allergens like pollens, molds, etc. So they usually come from environment rather than from peers directly. and therefore, it is not contagious.

Thanks for writing to us. 
The pain in the back with the burning in the back is likely to be due to a prolapsed disc with a nerve root compression. Going to a chiropractor will not help you much. You need prescription muscle relaxants and methylcobalamin supplements.

For this reason, I would recommend to temporary stop taking losartan or lisinopril and monitor your blood pressure. A head Up Tilt test would be needed to investigate for orthostatic hypotension. Regarding the leg swelling, it is not a common adverse effect related to the drugs that you have been taking. For this reason, I recommend performing further tests to investigate for the possible causes: - a cardiac ultrasound for heart failure- a chest X ray study- complete blood count- blood electrolytes- Kindey and liver function tests- a urine analysis- a Doppler ultrasound of the leg vessels for possible chronic venous insufficiency. You should discuss with your doctor on the above tests.

You may have some drugs or due to metabolic effect or due to resistance.  So just need to increase the dosage.  Go for repeat inr test after a month. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using health care magic.

What causes frequent yellow stools in a 3 month old? Hi my 3 month old daughter has been pooing 5/6 times a day since 48hrs ago. The colour is yellow which i m told is normal and its not excessively runny but is there anything to worry about. She is sucking her hands a lot which might be her starting to teeth. Should we be concerned yet. We also have been giving her water in between feeds to keep her de-hydrated.," Hi,You did right by giving her fluids to avoid dehydration. The teething doesn't start except after 6 months of age. So the suckling of the hands is just a habit some kids get used to. Since the stools are not runny then no need to worry, as some babies pass stool with every feed.Hope I have answered your query.

What does a fluid running sensation on side of head indicate? I have known trigeminal neuralgia (bilateral) for which I have gone through several surgeries on the right side in 2011 and 2012 and 1 surgery on the left side in 1995.

What could this possibly be?, Thank you for asking Healthcare majic. My name is Dr Ehsan Ullah & I have gone through your query. As you underwent shunt surgery you might be experiencing CSF running in the shunt...As the shunt might be ventriculo-peritoneal shunt which is placed sub-cutaneously placing ventricular reserviour under scalp and peritoneal end in the subcostal region.Due to passage of excess CSF from shunt reservior to peritoneal the presure exerted by csf in the shunt tube.Hope this may help you.

I do get relief by laying on the right side only"," Hello and welcome to Healthcare magic .Since your MRI scan has ruled out any gross CNS pathology , I am of the opinion that you might be suffering from Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo(BPPV ).Let me explain what that would mean ,The hallmark of BPPV is vertigo, i.e. an abnormal sensation of motion (usually spinning), that lasts for a few seconds or up to a minute.The symptoms are brought on by typical head movements, usually neck extension - such as with looking up at a high shelf or at the sky - or rotation to one side. The vertigo will commonly be felt when going to lie down in bed, or when rolling over to one side while in bed, and for this reason it is frequently first noticed at night or upon awakening.It spontaneously abates if the provocative position is maintained statically for a period of time (usually 30-60 seconds). For this reason, it should more accurately be called “positioning” vertigo, not “positional” vertigo, since it is movement into the position, not maintenance of the position, that provokes the symptoms.BPPV is thought to be caused by displacement of otoliths (mineral crystals) from the vestibule of the inner ear into the semicircular canals.You should see an ENT specialist who would perform simple clinical tests and manoeuvres to treat your condition .Cervical spondylosis can cause general dizziness rather than the 'spinning ' of vertigo .The allergies that you described do not have  a direct link with your vertigo .I hope that was helpful .Thanks .","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 19, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 9, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 97, 'clinical_accuracy': 19, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"

"Can bad breath caused by pancolitis be treated? I have been diagnosed with pancolitis and taking Delzicol for about 7 months.  Now I have terribly bad breath. Can this be a result of the colitis and can it be treated.  My teeth are in great shape; have regular cleanings every 6 months, no cavities, etc."," Hi,
 As per your medical history the chances of periodontal disease increases in ulcerative colitis or pancolitis. But you said there is no visible dental problem. 
 You need to visit a dentist to check if there is any marginal gingivitis that is making your breath bad. Also, upper GIT infections are also responsible for bad breath too. 
 Make sure you don't keep your stomach empty but when your gastroenterologist advises you. Brush your teeth twice daily, using mouth freshener tooth paste.

"What causes the heel pain in children? hello doctor , recently i have turned to amul brand, its been 3 months my kids are complaining about a pain in their heel is it due to amul taaza milk or any other reason. my son is 10 years and my daughtr is 8 years please suggest me should i stop giving this milk thank you"," THANKS FOR YOUR QUERY.Amul is not only the cause of the heel pain of your children.The most common cause of pediatric heel pain is a disorder called calcanealapophysitis which usually affects 8- to 14-year olds.Heel pain is caused by other conditions such as plantar fasciitis, tendonitis, bursitis, bone bruises or fractures.Sometimes, the simple strategy--Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation--resolves pain, but when healing does not happen soon, it’s time for clinical evaluation. Anti-inflammatory medications, physical therapy, or other treatments tailored for patients may be necessary.Preparation and recognition of warning signs can help prevent or reduce the severity of heel pain.Supportive shoes are a must, but it’s not always obvious when to switch shoes or adapt them for the best fit. Consider these guidelines:• Use inserts to raise the heel, especially in flat-footed cleats• Discard shoes that caused pain.  Don’t use them for another sport• Wear well-constructed shoes designed for specific sports• Switch cleats often because they are not supportive shoes.Don’t skip warm-up or cool-down exercises.HOPE THAT HELPS.","{'score': 95, 'clinical_accuracy': 19, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 9, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

 Joint pain is quite common after an episode of chikungunya. It will settle by itself with conservative measures.

first of all, i want you to know that only when the tooth is badly broken or cannot be restored ,until then your dentist will never indicate an extraction for you.
you have not mentioned anything about the broken teeth, are they front or back.
I will advise you to see an orthodontist first, only after a thorough dental check up, dentist can plan a treatment for you.
There might be a possibility that your broken teeth will be restored with a filling if possible.

 thanks for sharing your concern
 it is good to know that you have quit smoking now.
 do not worry. your palate shows signs of inflammation. that is why there is redness. 
 some times a specific lesion of the hard palate called STOMATITIS NICOTINA is seen in smokers. The red spot represents dilated and partially occluded orifices(opening) of accessory palatal salivary gland duct. 
 this inflammation is caused around the accessory palatal salivay gland duct. 
 on discontinuation of the habbit this should go. 
 observe for any associated changes. if so report to the dentist else you can wait and watch for few more weeks. 
 meanwhile you can take capsule becasoules 01 OD for fifteen days. 
 do use mouthwash daily, hexidine 2% for fifteen days. 
 take nutritious diet and remain stress free.

"What complications will I face if diabetes continues after delivery? Hi,I m 34weeks pregnant now and have gestational diabetes.

Taking insulin of 5units in morning, 3units in afternoon and 8units in night. What are the complications wil I face during delivery and will this diabetes continue after my delivery?"," Hello,uncontrolled gestational diabetes may cause babies to enlarge (particularly their shoulders). This enlargement may cause trouble during delivery and increase the risk for injuries to the baby and to the mother. There are several other potential complications but this is by far the more common. Your baby's weight is not that high, so it seems that diabetes has not affected it, although ultrasound scan evidence would be needed to say that for sure. Your blood glucose measurements are high - all three of them. The target levels are:- below 93 for fasting glucose- below 130 (and preferably below 120) for postprandial (1st hour) glucoseYou haven't mentioned what insulin you're using. I suppose it has to be NPH. Correcting the fasting blood glucose would usually require increasing night insulin (and perhaps adding a snack before bedtime to avoid hypoglycemia and/or ketosis). Since the morning hormones are hindering blood glucose control, you should be more careful in what you eat for breakfast. Avoiding high glycemic index carbohydrates will help. Gestational diabetes goes away after delivery - almost always!Checking your blood sugar the very next morning will convince you about that!Gestational diabetes increases your risk for type 2 diabetes in the near future so you've got to do an oral glucose tolerance test a couple of months after delivery and every three years ever after.I hope I've helped!If you'd like more information, please contact me again.Kind Regards and good luck with your pregnancy!","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

My tongue right now is sore and burns whenever I eat something. I have been drinking water all day today.

She never sits in one place. Now she is almost 2 years and she didn t start speaking yet. (except : bye-bye, chu chu : for a bird, tar : for star, niyo niyo : for a cat), Most of the time she listens to what we say. (Ex. Throw this in carbage, click on the lift button, switch on the lights, etc. ) .

This is big concern for us. Is she having symptoms of ADHD."," Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.
 By what you quote I feel your child is having hyperactivity. It may be an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Hyperactivity is a disorder of the mental makeup of the kid and not a physical deformity of the brain. Some kids may respond to iron simply and some kids my need other medications like Atomoxetine. But whatever it is the kids needs a thorough psychological evaluation and may be after behavioral therapy it might get better. But usually hyperactivity kids have very good IQ and if their energy can be diverted to a vocational training or any art or sport they like they will do wonders. I suggest you seek the help of a good pediatric psychologist. I wish your kid a speedy recovery. If you need any future medical consultation and suggestions, I will be glad to help.

I think she is having a reaction to the medication . What should i do and what should i give her to stop the itching.," Hi,Welcome to Hcm,There is a good possibility its a reaction to the drug. First thing to be done is to immediately stop all medicines. Give plenty of liquids for child to take orally.

 An x-ray or the knee is advised. 
 As you had a fall and a direct impact on the patella bone it is advised to take an x-ray. Post which it fractures is found than immobilization is advised. But if not fracture then exercise will be advised.
 Doing hot water fermentation, using knee cap, static hamstring, static Quadriceps, straight leg raise, and ankle toe movements will help improve the overall knee strength and functions.

What causes lump under the skin in 12 year old? 12 year old daughter developed a lump under the skin above the left collarbone..did an xray found a cartilage mass is ordering a CT scan also...any clue on what is could be...it doesn hurt her...she has had swollen lymp nodes at a younger age but they didn t hurt either.," Hello,
 It is good to know that you had CT done. Wait for the CT report. Your daughter has a history of swollen lymph nodes since a younger age. 
 Such lumps are commonly caused due to infection, enlargement of the lymph node, get her examined. The doctor may want to take a sample of the fluid for the test(study) to rule out cancer.
 Not all cysts & tumours are cancerous. It looks more like a lipoma, lipomas are harmless, if it is not growing there's no problem. 
 If it gets painful & affects daily life then it needs to be removed. Get your daughter evaluated & treated at the earliest.

Mother should go off cow's milk protein completely.

Feed you baby only exclusive breast feeds till 6 months of age and then start rice based feeds. 3.

 Welcome to HCM.
Based on the information provided the cause for the burning tongue is most likely to be due to Vitamin deficiency.
 Neither Fructose intolerance nor PCOS cause such symptoms.
 You have never mentioned whether you had any ulcers on tongue.
Deficinecy of Riboflavin, Zinc and Vitamin B12 often presents with similar complaints. So, taking multivitamin capsules containing these vitamins and minerals will relieve your problem.

Can soft tissue injury cause knee pain? I fell down the stairs and twisted my left leg at the hip and knee. I now have pain on the right hand side of my knee when I bend it . I can walk if my knee is straight this includes going up and down the stairs. Do I need to see someone or is it just a soft tissue injury," Hi,
 A soft tissue injury can cause a knee pain. This can also happen due to a minor capsular inflammation or decreased joint lubricants.

Thanks for your query.
From your history it seem your pain in upper right abdomen and burning increases after eating so you are probably trying to avoid food.This is a sign of gastritis that is inflammation of stomach lining due to acidity.Drinking cold milk will help reduce the burning.
You can take over the counter medicine like Digene gel for relief and if do not feel better please consult a doctor and get medicine prescribed.He may prescribe you a proton pump inhibitor group medicine and you shall be fine.
Take care.

 Throat irritation is often associated with ear symptoms - like fullness or pressure.   There is tube connecting the two - Eustachian tube - middle ear to oro-pharynx (throat).   The tonsil irritation could be from infection (virus, bacteria, some times a fungus) or allergy or even mechanical - from food and so on.  Post nasal drip could also cause.   
            Tobacco in ANY FORM is bad.   Only the effects of additives like tar and so on are avoided by the  the so called smokeless tobacco.   
           You seem to be intelligent and informed / partially motivated- you MUST try and stop the tobacco

 If your mother responded POSITIVELY (meaning robustly) to the SYNDOPA she was given back in the day and she continues to enjoy good relief from each dose she takes then, it may be worth taking her for a surgical consultation to see what her candidacy for either DBS (deep brain stimulation) therapy may be or a GI device called DUODOPA which is an intestinal gel that is continuously pumped into the intestine. 
 He sudden STIFFNESS or freezing is not uncommonly seen in Parkinson's Disease but if she were also (for argument's sake) UNRESPONSIVE or looking as if she were ""zoning out"" then, you should mention this to the neurologist (or even film an episode) to consider the possibility of a type of epileptic episode which require a workup and other treatment if an EEG were to discover this as a problem.

"Why does the cubital tunnel syndrome show inaccurate EMG results? I have been frustrated with cubital tunnel syndrome for the past three years. I have had five surgeries, each time to put the nerve deeper and to remove scarring on the nerve. It keeps coming back. Surgery always removes the symptoms.

On an echocardiogram, the doctor said that the test was reading the signals from bottom up instead of top down. So, it was giving a false positive. I am wondering if this is happening with emgs.

I need to know. But please don t respond based on what statistics say should happen. I have had this thing on both sides, and have had three recurrences--due to scarring of the nerve.

 Since there is a poor correlation between EMG and clinical data, I think that second opinion and a second EMG elsewhere should be done.

 As the knot is a fascia inflammation and will take some time to go. This will be helped by normal biomechanics of the muscles and the correction of the muscle imbalances by the body itself.

What causes less enamel in the teeth? Hi.  My son had vomiting as a small child (not reflux).  We were referred to a paediatrician.  He was prescribed sandomigran for a while.  He eventually had a barium meal to see if there was something wrong with his gut.  He is now 13 and has grown out of all of this. Anyway both his baby teeth and now his adult teeth on his bottom right of his mouth have come through with very little enamel.  Is this anything to do with the vomitting or the medication?," Hello,Enamel can be damaged by acid in the mouth. The stomach acid included in vomit with repeat episodes can easily damage the enamel on teeth. This would occur after the teeth are errupted and have been exposed to the acidic environment. This could then be the case with the baby teeth.Now you state the adult teeth have weak enamel. This could be a genetic weakness. Nutrition and medication taken while the teeth are forming will affect the quality of the tooth structure. Baby teeth can be damaged if baby sleeps with a bottle with milk products coating teeth and causing decay. Flouride can be given with children's vitamins to strengthen the formation of the tooth while developing. As adults the addition of flouride is not recommended because teeth are already formed. Instead, topical flouride can help strengthen formed tooth enamel. Too much fluoride taken as a child can have the reverse effect of weakened enamel forming. Often white spots are seen and indicate too much fluoride. The antibiotic Tetracycline is known to darken the layer under enamel and cause grey to brown banding if taken while teeth are forming. No concern with this type of discoloration when taken as an adult.The medication, Pizotifen, does not report any significant dental side affects concerning enamel. This is not available in the United States, so I am not familar with this drug for my patients. Drugs can have interactions and you can question your pediatrician with this concern. Can you tell me why as a child, this medication was recommended? Were migraine headaches determined to be the cause of his vomiting? I am glad to hear he is feeling better. Enamel is precious. Avoid an acidic diet and abrasive brushing techniques. Regular dental exams will check for enamel weakness as these areas will be more prone to decay. Rinsing with flouride may strenghten enamel. Restorative procedures maybe recommended such as bonding or crowns to replace damaged enamel. I hope my recommendations are helpful to you and I will be glad to provide additional answers if you have more concerns.

 .
 The side effects are individualized. Mostly the drugs are well tolerated by most masses. A few though report some side effects. The commonly reported side effects include:
1. Tablet Omnacortil is associated with gastritis/ulcers/dyspepsia; weight changes, high blood pressure and elevated blood sugars. Prolonged use is associated with calcium depletion and osteoporosis and one cannot stop it cold turkey. 
2. Deslor is associated with dryness, dry mouth, headache, nausea, gastrointestinal disturbances, dizziness, drowsiness, etc.
3. Montemac - L might interact with deslor and increasing its side effects. Instead plain montelukast which has less interactions may be tried. Motelukast can cause mild headache and some gastrointestinal disturbances.
 The information leaflet given along with these drugs will contain side effect profile of each of these drug. Consider referring to it for more details.

"Had molar extracted, did root canal, loss of sleep, on nurofen. What can help pain? hi i have a second molar extracted yesterday,the dentist try to save the tooth doing a root canal treatment but the tooth still heart after so i decide to extracted but last night i could not sleep i take nurofen 400 mg three times a day and is very painful and my check is swallow ,what can I do or what tablet to take,wait your answer thank you"," Some amount of pain and discomfort is expected for few days after tooth extraction. Amount of pain which occurs after tooth extraction is dependent on procedure which is used for the extraction of the tooth and the degree of trauma to the adjacent tissues.Pain can be managed after tooth extraction withover the counter pain medicaments.Analgesics are given after the tooth extraction to relieve the pain.During the first 24 hours after tooth extraction, you should take soft and liquid diet and should avoid taking food from the side where tooth was extracted. It is advised to do warm saline rinses 24 hours after the tooth extraction to reduce the pain and swelling. Take rest.You should avoid spitting, sucking, drinking anything with straw for minimum of 24 hours after tooth extraction and should not smoke for minimum of 2 days after tooth extraction.Smoking can create negative pressure and can cause dislodgement of clot and lead to dry socket.
It is also common to have pain in the jaw after the extraction as the mouth is held open for long time during the tooth extraction. Massaging the muscles gently, hot compresses application and over the counter analgesics can reduce the soreness of the jaw. Allow relaxation of the muscles and the jaw joint and don’t take hard crusted foods.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

Why there is a bruise on the back? My mother is suffering with alot of back pain and there is also a purple bruise there on her right hand side above the buttock and the pain goes right across her lower back.

Morever, the back pain could be because of multitude of causes, primary could be arthritis itself or a disk herniation or lumbar spinal stenosis. does the pain occur more walking downhill or is it relieved by bendin forward. check if she feels pain on walking on toes.if yes, she could be having lumbar spinal stenosiss common at this age.

When testicular cancer has metastasized to distant areas like abdominal lymphnodes then the 5-year survival rate is 71%.

Snoring is a structural, anatomic issue. when you sleep, the muscles around your neck area relax. the airway, instead of being fully open, gets floppy. it is the sound of air going through a floppy pipe, essentially, that causes the snoring noise. The amount of airway closure that occurs increases if you are on muscle relaxers, drink alcohol, or (most common) if you are overweight. If you are waking up at night and feeling fatigued during the day, as well as snoring loudly, these are all signs of possible sleep apnea, which very commonly occurs in heavy snorers. I would advice seeing your primary care doctor about this in order to obtain a sleep study referral. In the mean time, there are several over the counter anti snoring devices that basically all work by keeping the airway more open.

This is caused by aggregator bacter which results in severe bone loss. Nothing to be panic, consult a periodontist and get it treated with root planing and grafting with bone graft.

The right side of my forehead started going numb every once in awhile. It s been happening a lot more often and now is numb almost 24/7. I also noticed that I started having really annoying eye twitches. This happens on my right side also. Another weird symptom is I keep smelling a really odd smell throughout the day. At first, I thought it was just a classroom I was sitting in, but now I m noticing it in random places throughout the day. Could these symptoms be related? What could be going on and are these symptoms normal?"," Hello,
 Thanks for the query,
 I understand your problem
 I have noted your complaints. I feel that a possibility of epilepsy- complex partial seizure need exclusion in your case. This can be done by two tests 1. MRI scan of the brain 2. EEG test- a test which will tell us if you have seizures. These two tests will clarify the situation. 
 Hope this clarifies

"Suggest cure for rash on the neck Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ? Please type your query here...Hi my daughter is 14 weeks she has rash on her neck arms and tummy that resembles prickly heat but she has a blotchy rash on back that s hot and looks as tho she has sun burn... Can u help?"," Hi Dear,Understanding your concern. As per your query you have symptoms of rashes on the neck which is very common due to fact as dirt and moisture get trapped by your clothing and leading to blockage of sebaceous glands. Need not to worry. I would suggest you to keep this area clean and dry. Apply warm compresses with soaked towel and apply vitamin C serum at night. You should avoid touching or pricking rashes. Apply ice pack on rashes 2-3 times a day. If condition doesn't get better then consult dermatologist for proper examination. Doctor will examine physically along with blood test and sample for lab test. Doctor may prescribe  antibiotics like clindamycin along with anti inflammatory medications.

CT Scan report says pansinusitis but she has no signs and symptoms. Chest Xray is clear.PFT shows mild obstructive disorder and reversibility. No history of asthma . On emergency had given Efcorlin and antibiotic. She is at present on Telekast 10mg and Allegra 120mg since 2.5 months. Why has she developed breathlessness? Is it due to turbinate? What has to be done? What are the side effects of these drugs? Is surgery required? I request for immediate advice. Regards Lucy Antony. Kolkata.," THIS IS ALLERGIC DISEASES AND SINUSITIS IS COMPLICATION OF FREQUENT ALLERGIES
TURBINATE IS ALSO COMPLICATION OF ALLERGIES
IN LATER STAGES THEREIS POST NASAL DRIP FROM SINUSES WHICH CAUSES BREATHLESSNESS
EVEN IF YOU GO FOR SURGERY IF YOU DONT CURE ALLERGIES IT WILL REOCCUR AGAIN
MY BEST ADVISE IS TO GO FOR  TREATMENT OF SINUSES BY MEDICINES IT TAKES 3 MONTHS TO CLEAN SINUSES WITH MEDICINES
WITH MY EXPERIENCE START TAB GRIS OD 375 MGM ONCE A DAY
TAB MONTELUCAST AND FEXOFENADINE COMBINATION(MONTAIR FX)TWICE A DAY AS YOU ARE TAKING SAPERATELY
SYP ASCORIL 1/2 TSF BD
SYP TOSSEX 1/2 TSF AT NIGHT WITHWARM WATER
APPLY NEOSPORIN H EYE OINTMENT IN NOSE TWICEA DAY
SEA WATER IN THE FORM OF DROPS AT NIGHT
NO STEAM,NO ANALGIN,PARACETAMOL,BRFEN,VITAMINS AND MULTIVITAMINS
DICLOFENIC AND MEFTAL CAN BE TAKEN FOR FEVER AND PAIN
STOP ALL DIARY AND MILK PRODUCTS FOR 3 MONTHS

 No, surgeries have no impact on immune system of both. Hence surgeries can not produce allergies. Some allergies are late onset and seen typically after 40-50 years of age. This is due to change in immune system. So it is quite possible to develop new allergies after 50 years of age.

Should I keep checking for Brain aneurysms even the MRI shows normal since my family history has this disorder? I was diagnosed with multiple brain aneurysms in 2003. I had my first surgery in Dec of 2003 in NYC and they did a coiling procedure in the largest aneurysm. Then Jan of 2005 I had another procedure in NJ and had a stent put in the artery that had the aneurysm that was coiled. The coiling shifted a bit and there was another aneurysm in the same area so the stent protected the artery for both aneurysms and no coiling was needed. I had MRA's for a few years and I moved to PA and in 2011 I had an angiogram to check everything out and they saw that the remaining aneurysm grew so they decided to do a stent coiling procedure that year in PA. I had an angiogram a few months later and everything looked good and this month I had an MRA and that looked good too. The Interventional Neuro surgeon said that I never have to be checked again and just stay on 325 aspirin.

 Thanks for asking the query,
 Due to trauma from broken tooth you have developed an ulceration on the on the cheek mucosa.
I would suggest you to visit the Dentist and you can get the sharp bordres of the wisdom tooth removed by selective grinding,or else  take an x-ray of the tooth and you can go for extraction of the tooth.
Wisdom tooth does not have nay significant role in mastication and occlussion so its better to get it extracted if causing trouble.
 Apply Dologel oral ointment topically over the affected area.
Maintain a good oral hygiene use antiseptic mouthwash gargles twice daily.
Take multivitamin tablets.
 Hope this helps out.

Stage I and II have better chances of complete cure and recovery than stages III and IV.Therefore if your father is having stage I or II cancer then he might require surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy sessions.

"Had a full upper denture and partial lower denture procedure, had swollen gland with cold. Is it serious? Hello...on Nov. 5th, 2012, I had a full upper denture and partial lower denture procedure. Overall, things went well and the pain was manageable but I did notice a pain in my throat on the right side for the first few weeks, similar to having a swollen gland when ill with a cold. The pain along with the general pain from having 22 teeth extracted gradually subsided and I have been back to my dentist for a few adjustments due to sore spots and have had no other complaints.

My dentist is evaluating me for a realignment on January 7, but is out of the office until that time. Should I be alarmed at this acute discomfort or is it a typical malady? Thank you in advance for your assistance! Pat/Female/57"," hi Pat,
first you have to be very specific that you are wearing partial denture in anterior or posterior region,
because this pain may be due to overextended denture as you are saying that they are ill fitting.
to rule out this stop wearing your denture for 1-2 days, if you start getting relief than this is the only cause & you have to go for realignment.
 After extractions we always wait for few months before making denture because bone resorption is very fast in first few months of extraction.
if you feel any gland enlargement, and don't get any relief than better visit your  ENT surgeon & in the mean time you can start up with course of antibiotic including azithromycin 500mg once daily for 3 days & ibuprofen 400 mg (SOS) , don't do any heat application by yourself.

I have took him to an allergist I ve taking anything lactose away from him and he still getting the diarrhea. I feel hope less"," Hello Kersy,
Sorry to note that you feel helpless with your current situation.
Chronic diarrhoea in a three year old can have several reasons:
1. Depending on the geographical location, coeliac disease (immne reaction against wheat proteins) definitely must be excluded. Blood tests such as IgA-TTG and IgA-endomysium are available, and duodenal biopsy is the final test if serological tests are inconclusive. I am not sure why a diagnosis of lactose intolerance was made with the biopsy as it is NOT possible to say, this needs to be discussed with your doctor.
2. Lactose intolerance is far commoner than coeliac disease, and complete avoidance usually leads to normalisation of GI system, unless he has a concominant wheat intolerance as well. 
3. Irritable bowel syndrome can happen in kids, although toddler's diarrhoea at this age is also a possibility that settles on its own as he grows up.
4. Infection-related diarrhoea needs to be excluded, or whether he is antibody deficient (such as IgA deficiency, or hypogammaglobulianemic [all 3 Ig isotypes low] which can be diagnosed with a simple blood test.
I hope that was helpful.

Welcome to Health Care Magic
 Symptoms lasting more than 2 months dictates the need to see your doctor and undergo investigations.
 For palpitation – HOLTER (24 to 48 hour ambulatory monitoring) / ECHOcardiogram / TMT (Treadmill exercise ECG) / LABORATORY work-up – and so on will all be necessary for further assessment and assistance.  You may even need Electro Physiological Studies (EPS), if there is no improvement.   In the mean time, you should see your Internist for possible stepping up the dose of your beta-blocker.
 For diarrhoea – start with stool examination.  Abdominal CT and/ot Colonoscopy may be necessary.
 Take care
Wishing speedy recovery
God bless
Good luck","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

About month ago my lower back started bruising without reason and its very stiff. At my work I am very careful ( personal support worker) and I never had any injury related to my job. What can caused that weird bruising?"," Hello and Welcome to HCM, 
Thanks for writing to us.
The sudden onset of a bruise of unknown cause should not be taken to lightly, this could be an indication of either a blood clotting problem (low platelet production or increased rate of removal of platelets from blood), a reaction to any medications you could be taking (eg. aspirin, coumadin, some pain management medication, etc.), accidental ingestion of a poisonous substance (eg. rat poison, etc.).
It is best you just visit a doctor for a blood work up, once all the results return normal, there should be absolutely nothing to worry about, and this bruise could have been caused accidentally (like scratching yourself while you were asleep, etc.).
Hope this helps you.
Wishing you good health...

Parathyroid gland removal refers to a type of surgery done to remove these glands. It’s also known as a parathyroidectomy. This surgery might be used if your body is producing too much calcium. This is a condition known as hypercalcemia.Due to the surgery, the only effect on your body will be, low production of calcium, which has nothing to do with anxiety, panic attacks and muscle aches.Either you are really anxious about the surgery procedure and after effects which caused the panic attacks, or some of the given medicines created such a scenario.

"Suggest treatment for pain in collar bone Hi, I have been having a severe aching pain across my collar bones for around 6 months. The pain comes and goes but when it is there it is so intense. I go swimming 3 times a week and live on a healthy diet. There is no swelling around the collar bones....can you help please?"," Hello,
 Clavicular pain could due to many things starting from a bad sleeping posture to shoulder injuries or even due to syndromes like thoracic outlet syndromes:
 Which happens due to compression of nerves and vessel between your neck and armpit and will have several other symptoms like pain over shoulder, neck, arm, discoloration of the arm, etc which kindly look for.
 Since the pain has been there for 3 months we need to rule out these possibilities which need evaluation in the form of x-ray, NCS, etc. So get to an orthopedic. Till THAT YOU CAN DO:
 1) Immobilize the shoulder joint
2) Take pain killers like ibuprofen and Omeprazole
3) Also, take calcium and vitamin d supplement
4) Can apply a sling over through your neck and arm if the pain gets very nasty
5) Get an orthopedic consultation.
 Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.
 Take care

 Infectious sore throat is usually caused be a virus and resolves with pain medication along with the other modalities that were suggested. If , however, you are seeing a yellow discoloration, it may indicate a bacterial source for the pain which may require treatment with antibiotics.
You may want to revisit your doctor for a reassessment.
 There are non infectious causes of sore throat such as post nasal drip in sinusitis, in some cases of GERD, trauma, lesions within the throat.
IF the doctor reviews your throat and thinks that a course of antibiotics is necessary then the symptoms, if due to bacterial infection should resolve provided adequate antibiotics are given and there is no resistance.
If you still have pain despite adequate treatment, then it would be necessary to look for other possible causes.
 I hope this helps","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 7, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 97, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 81, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 9}"

Thanks for writing to us.,
The T.wysolone is a potent steroid which can reduce non infective or sterile inflammation of the nerve root in radiculopathy and thatswhy your doctor would have prescribed the same and tapered it.The potential benefits do not overweigh the risks or side effects of this class of medicine.
You have to bear in mind that Wysolone causes Gastro intestinal problems such as Nausea/Vomitting/Peptic Ulcers/Osteoporosis/Cataract/Premature onset of Diabetes/Hypertension/Harmonal Imbalance in women/Menstrual Irregularities/
In addition to Wysolone ,you are taking Diclofenac which in turn increases the corrossive effects on Stomach.
Kindly avoid this Wysolone in future.
Please consult a Neurosurgeon/Spine Surgeon for all your needs.
Please Start a Soft Neck collar/Physiotherapy/Neck Extension Excercises and ultimately minimal access Neuro Endoscopic Surgery to Cure the disc lesions.
Wishing you a speedy recovery.,

This is a normal response to an insect bite, especially mosquitoes, that you get. The response to fiery red ants, wasps and bees may provoke an anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction) response but not against mosquitoes.
A mild potency setroid cream (betamethasone) and anti-histamines taken over 3-4 days usually suffices as treatment of skin reactions to mosquito bites in adults. 
However, if you are getting bruises or dark areas on severe scratching, you need to ensure that you do not have an abnormal platelet number (low) that leads to the bruising. A complete blood count test should tell you the platelet number.

due to the damage to the brain due to trauma, one becomes unconscious to avriable levels of coma and for variable periods.

                                   You had typhoid fever 1 year back. During typhoid the intestines and liver are effected badly probably that is the reason for your weakness, Abdominal pain, associated anorexia, hence stiff ness of muscles, change in stools colour, etc. are all suggest intestinal effect. 
                                    Some times you are getting burning sensation of urine , may suggest urine infection, Or metabolic acidosis due to above reasons. 
                                    I adviseyou to consult a gastroenterologist for diagnosis and treatment. You may have to take U.S.scanning besides other routine tests for confermation.

"Tingling in legs and hand, diabetic, high BP, cholestrol. Are Nervz injection safe to use ? Age 60 years ,Height 5foot, weight 56 FemaleMedical history- diabetes for past 8 years, cholesterol, High BP, Thyroid taking 75 Mg thyrox, suspicious nature;Tingling in the legs and hand ( as if blood circulations stops)Problem Should I take Nervz injections(3ml from Intas), is it safe for me to use..any side effects"," Hello,
Your symptoms suggest that you are suffering from peripheral neuropathy. While diabetes is a frequent cause of neuropathy, it is not the only cause. Nutritional deficiencies (B-12 and folate), chemical exposures, pressure on nerves, or medications like chemotherapy medications etc. can also cause neuropathy.
You must consult your doctor to find the exact cause of your problem.
In case your symptoms are due to VIT B 12 deficiency or folate deficiency,injection NERVZ would help you but in case it is due to diabetic neuropathy,then it would not make any difference.
You must then consult your doctor and get yourself tested for the presence of diabetic neuropathy.
A variety of tests, including electromyography (a test that measures the response of muscles to electrical impulses) and nerve conduction studies (a study of the flow of electrical current through the nerves) combined with clinical observations may help a physician rule out other possible causes of pain and diagnose neuropathy. 
 Although there has been considerable advances in the understanding behind the development of diabetic neuropathy but their treatment has been limited.
Along with a meticulous and tight control of blood sugar levels,treatment is aimed at reducing pain and other associated symptoms.
This is achieved by use of antidepressants like DULOXETIN ,use of anticonvulsant like PREGABALIN and a long acting opioid like TAPENTADOL.
 You must discuss with your doctor to use these drugs singly or in different combinations.

The commonest reasons for pain in abdomen and regurge in mouth or vomiting are as follows:-Tummy tonsils- meaning enlargement of the lymph nodes of the abdomen.-Appendicitis- by default this has to be ruled out in every case of pain in -abdomen of a child.-Worms.The best diagnosis is a high resolution ultrasonography. some blood, urine and stool tests.A therapeutic trial with a course of an antibiotic, metronidazole and probiotics under the guidance of a pediatrician / Surgeon always helps to solve the problem and to get a diagnosis.Also given is a dose of medicines active against worms in intestine.I hope a consultation with a Pediatric Surgeon, investigations and a course of an antibiotic and metronidazole should solve the problem.If this is indicative of appendicitis , please go for the surgery of appendectomy.","{'score': 89, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"
Is pain in arm normal post a cortisone shots? I got a cortisone shot on friday morning and although the initial pain has subsided. I now have a burning sensation in my arm similar to when i was on magnesium sulfate for my blood pressure. It feels like I have someone shoving razor blades through my veins. Is this normal or do i need to go to the er?," Hi,
 You have not mentioned whether you have this shot in your muscles or in your veins, but as per your history and symptoms it appears that you have an intravenous injection. Usually, this type of pain occurs when there is some inflammation of injected vein occurs post injection (thrombophlebitis). You need to apply some counter-irritant ointment over the injected site and give rest to the part, it will gradually wean off in 3-5 days.
 Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Will treatment plan change if malignant lesions are located near original tumor? I have a 9 mm invasive ductal carcinoma which is less than 1 cm.

 An x-ray of the hip and lumbar spine is advised.
 As this matter looks to be related to the bony injury or soft tissue injury in the lower back due to fall and having an injury is common in that region due to the impact.

"What does pain in the upper back indicate? Ever since a day ago, I started having mid to upper-mid back pain when swallowing food only, not liquids. I noticed it started happening after I twisted my back to pop it. Could that have caused it? Or could it be something seriously bad? What s wrong with me?"," Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.
 You have just described what is probably odynophagia. I would like to know whether the pain occurs only on swallowing or is it increased on swallowing and is present otherwise as well. In any condition, there seems to be a damage to the structural component of the neck which may include something as minor as muscle spasm to trauma to the bone or neck. You should ideally meet a neurologist to examine and confirm the diagnosis and thereafter go in for an MRI of the neck. Do let me me know the report as soon as possible. Meanwhile try paracetamol for pain (if it is continuous) and try liquid and soft diet- it may afford less pain when swallowing. Awaiting your report.
 Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}"

After going through 2 pain clinics I can't find a doctor who is open to listening to my problems without thinking I'm looking for drugs or a ""drug doctor"".  I'm having trouble because first clinic, due to miscommunication, thinks I lied about meds and I have my notes how it transpired.

Many are benign, while some are malignant.NETs are believed to arise from various neuroendocrine cells whose normal function is to serve at the neuroendocrine interface. Neuroendocrine cells are present not only in endocrine glands throughout the body that produce hormones, but also diffused in all body tissues. In your case it affects spine so peripheral nervous system is affected,it can be either neuroblastoma or paraganglioma or schwannoma.So pain will be more of neuralgic in nature.You require pregablin 75 mg once daily then increase to twice daily as per your symptoms plus amitryptilline /nortryptilline 10mg bed time.Hope this will help you.RegardsDr Sandhya ManorenjNeurophysicianHi Tech city Hyderabad","{'score': 93, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 5, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"

Depending upon your age the further guess work can be made. If you are 40+ then there are chances of early degenerative changes in the bone. If you are lower than it than chances of soft tissue injury chances are there.Now to help you better, i will advice to take an MRI scan of the knee to understand the internal structures of the knee. As without knowing the internal structures of the knee, it will be a provisional diagnosis, and the use of the technology will help provide good inputs.Further more, you need a thorough lower limb musculokseletal assessment as to check the strength in the muscle and based on that the exercises will be implemented by the physical therapist.Also, once the MRI confirms the knee internal structures it will help further to plan the rehabilitation.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 92, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"

She does however have terrible pain in her mouth. If they are detecting this in her blood.....should there not be something somewhere producing this ? detector in her blood?," Hi,Thanks for writing in.A paraneplastic syndrome is a condition where there are symptoms that are triggered by an altered immune system response to a neoplasm. Sometimes such tumors can remain hidden in locations which are not easily accessible for evaluation. These are known as occult locations and need to be diagnosed with precise tests and investigations. A single test might not help in locating these tumors and this requires that the person should be under observation and series of tests to be done. Minimally invasive investigations like endoscopy or higher imaging scans might help. There are neuroendocrine tests to measure the amount of neuroendocrine transmitter chemicals in various organs and blood channels. Sampling process needs to be done specifically and involves a oncology team discussion.

 Meanwhile apply long knee extension brace to stabilize knee. Visit to arthroscopic surgeon for detailed assessment is recommended. 
 Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

 Thank you for posting your query.
 Scoliosis refers to sideways bending of spine. This may be a congenital (by birth) finding or it may be due to disease of spine or spinal cord.
 Initial treatment is with physiotherapy and pain medications.
 If you are not better, please consult a neurologist and Orthopedic surgeon for detailed evaluation and treatment.

This swelling of jaw is very painful and patient is unable to open the mouth.It is not always that wisdom teeth causes problems but if they are impacted they can be really dreadful and if ignored they can cause several complications ranging from gum diseases, decay and damage of other teeth. So getting the treatment for wisdom teeth is very important and the treatment is extraction of wisdom teeth.In addition to this, you must be open with your dentist regarding any reservations that you may have about the procedure. You have to discuss the dangers as well as the advantages of doing the procedure. Furthermore, you also have to decide whether you feel that the procedure would be good for you. After the discussion, if you are still not satisfied with all the information that the doctor gave you, it is best to have a second opinion about the matter.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"
What is the solution for hurting in toe? My right big toe hurt when i touch it and to my surprise when I removed the nail polish the nail was dark green.  I proceeded to file the area and upon doing that the colored section of the toenail came off.  now the toenail itself doesnt hurt but the area around the joint of the toe hurts and if i squeeze my toe clear liquid comes out through the section where my toenail came off.," Hi,In my opinion this is a type of infection usually fungal or bacterial. Unless there isn't a cyst or an abscess under your toe or your skin. I don't think you have to worry about it. Try bandaging your toe properly after applying topical anti-fungal or antibiotic ointments (nowadays there are oints that have both with addition of steroid). Avoid moisture, keep your toe dry clean and dressing it with bandaging and oints twice a day for 3 to 4 days would be enough. If it persists for more than a week I would recommend a dermatologist.

"What is causing the pain and the lump on my right leg? Hi. I started with this strong pain on the outside of my right leg, from the knee area down to the ankle. The pain went away, but a burning pain developed right over the fibula and now I have a small soft lump. I am scared to death that it could be a bone cancer. Help me, please. Thank you"," Hello,
 I don't think this is cancer so please be relaxed. Because cancer cannot be just predicted by all such soft lumps.
 For now, I will advise you to do icing and simple exercises for the lower limbs to have a balancing strength on both sides. Usually, you get pain and aches if there is any ligament injury like a sprain in the knee and the swelling of the adjacent joints as they take maximum stress for the weight bearing.
 Your pain should be fine after icing and simple exercises. In my clinical practice of over 12 years, most cases have a ligament injury in the knee and the symptoms of the tibiofibular joint are examined. With icing and simple exercises for correction of muscle, an imbalance has regained full functions.

Changes in weather condition can lead to cold and cough resulting in congestion in chest.It happens due to the secretion of mucus in lungs so to reduce the congestion you need to get treated.Please take plain steam inhalations;and if it is troubling you more then visit a doctor and take nebulization with normal saline and medicine if required.Also get examined by the doctor so that if there is a need he may give you antibiotics.As for the cramps in abdomen due to periods you can take tablet-Cyclopam or Meftal spas.

Do not put the baby in lying position after feeding till the baby burps out the swallowed air.2.

If you are needing to use the abuterol >3 times a day then you need to be on streoid inhalers and use this only when required.
Combination inhalers (steroids + long-acting beta agonists) are to be used only when the steroid inhaler on its own is insufficient to control your asthma. 
The ther good combination is a steroid inhaler plus montelukast which will require lesser use of abuterol.
Hope this helps.","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 7, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"
"What will happen if the liver is more than 3cm in size? I have a baby of 2 and a half month old, exclusively breastfed and weighs 7.6kg. Yesterday during our pediatric visit for vaccination , his doctor told that he has liver with more than 3cm in size and said its more than normal. I am worried.

Thus this finding may be absolutely normal.However, an enlarged liver is also found in a lot of disease conditions. The diagnosis would only be possible if the associated symptoms and clinical findings in the baby are correlated. Based on the clinical suspicion lab reports may be ordered to confirm.It is not possible to give you an entire list of conditions causing liver enlargement, not only because it is too vast but also because it might just end up scaring you more than you ought to be.However, what can be done for now is that you keep a watch watch any associated symptoms. This symptoms may include fever, yellowish discoloration of skin/eyes/urine, pale colored stools, altered smell in urine, abdominal swelling, breathlessness, swelling in any other part of body, decreased urine output, decreased feeding, excessive or poor weight gain, spots over body or any other skin or hair changes etc. If you find any of these, I would advice you to have a detailed talk with your pediatrician and based on the clinical assumptions you may decide on the further course of action.If you need any more guidance do write back.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

Upper right abdomen pain radiating to back is characteristic for gallbladder stones, gallbladder inflammation and pancreas diseases. It likes to come and go. It appears mostly right after a meal. 
Pain in ribs area can be also caused by neuralgia of ribs nerves. Both, gallbladder diseases and neuralgia aches more when breathing.
Pain in testicles area and back pain on the same side are mostly caused by urinary tract infection or kidney stones especially when associated with burning when urinating. Pain in testicle/groin area can be caused by testicles and epidydimis infections, testicles tumors, inguinal hernia and prostate gland infection.
It is possible that pain in your chest and testicles pain has nothing in common as diseases can be  concomitant.

I am trying to keep him as hydrated as I can now. But based on this explanation, what do you think is going on here? Pls help."," Hello Veena,
Thanks for writing in.
 There are several disorders which can cause fainting in children. This could include arrhythmias, seizures, problems in the heart like coarctation of aorta or a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or simply a hot shower.  It is good that you are keeping him hydrated, but to take this further, I would like to know whether an echocardiogram has been done for him. If not, please get it done. An echocardiogram is an ultrasound of the heart which allows us to look at the valves and the chambers of the heart. If this is normal, we can be sure that there is nothing wrong with the structure of the heart.
The possibility of seizures also needs to be evaluated. Ask your son if you can tell when he is going to faint. If he can, there is a chance that he has a complex partial seizure. we would need an EEG to find out whether he is actually having these seizures.
Hope this helps.

 Thanks for writing in. You have not mentioned about the details of your breast cancer treatment (like size of tumor, grade, receptor status, node positivity, etc). These are required to understand the risks of it coming back.

"Diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis, hemochromatosis and hypothyroidism. Back pain.MRI showing inflammation. Need advice hello doctor, I'm 49 years old, female, 2 kids, 18 and 15 years old via sectio,I have very much problems with my health for about 13-14 years now, tired, joint pains,  and now diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis, hemochromatosis and hypo-thyroidie. For hemochromatosis I had 8 times bloodletting within 3,5 months. It wasn't nice, I didn't feel great. Than I started with erytrocytafereses, a double doses in one time, a week later my terrible back pain suffering started. this was early july 2012. in september an Xray showed an inflammation of my right sacra-ilium. the MRI confirmed the inflammation. I was on naxopren 500mg 2 times a day since july 2012 and also 4 times paracetamol 1000mg. HLA b27 pos. two weeks before the backpain started I had a slip-up twice with my right leg. and it did hurt. years ago I had dislocated sacro joints, my physiotherapist did fix that each time. this time when the hurting started I couldn't lift up my leg, couldn't lay down or sit. My osteopath did help me en located the joint and some thoracle vertebras. but the pain remained. My reumatologist gave me Arcoxia but I did feel much sicker with these medicine,  back on naxopren and than she gave me fenylbutazon, but that was even harder than the arcoxia. so in january I was allowed to start with Simponi, 1 doses each month. because of the monthly afereses I have to take the Simponi right after that. the combination is very hard. I also get paronychia on both hands, it hurts very much, my nails do come of, headache, nauseous, I had a terrifying heartstop at night and also spontaneous tinnitus after the second injection. I really don't want to take this medicine again, in those two months the pain still stayed the same. So, as for what they say about Bechterew, keep on moving, don't lay down, is not for me, each and every step is so hurtful and when I lay down the pain is reducing. and my back is less hurting. I don't wake up at night from pain. Since the bloodletting I do have a good night rest (I didn't have a good sleep since about 13 years), but unfortunately still tired through the day. 4 weeks ago I decided to take out the Mirena device, (this was my third, so I have had Mirena devices for 14 years now) I feel like another woman. I have more endurance, sometimes less tired, my skin is better, but the pain is still here. But my back is more flexible, i can reach the floor and i can walk straight up, so I do think this is great. My theory is that the Mirena causes a sterile inflammation in the uterus and this can get my immuunsystem on the run. but now I ask you, can you think with me? what can i do now. Next week I have to go to my reumatologist. I wish there was someone who has the brains for the 3 illnesses together. so what is the best treatment for me, thinking of the combinations of the illnesses. Is there a specialist who has the knowlegde of those 3 illnesses. I hope to hear from you. thank you in advance. Dorine"," Hello. 
Thanks for writing to us. 
Since you have immune related problems, the multiple problems that you are having are common. You need a detailed clinical monitoring for the treatment. The dosage regulation needs to be done after a clinical response assessment.
I hope this information has been both informative and helpful for you.

Steroids are anti inflammatories and check the pain in any region of the body. It is given orally or as injections in the concerned area.Steroids do not control the progress of cancer and other treatments have to be continued to control the disease. Steroids also cause side effects and water retention is one of them.As he is not having pain, there is no urgent need to give him pain medications.

Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.By what you quote it should be an urticarial or a simple skin allergy. You can use Hydroxyzine at 1-2mg/kg/dose every 6th to 8th hourly for 7-10 days. Most important thing to be remembered is that it has a propensity to recur (called as second crop) within 10-14 days. If this happens, you can start using the same medicine but I suggest you get the kid evaluated with your paediatrician.Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time.

 As you had a fall. An x-ray of the chest is suggested. Any direct fall over the rib cage may lead to hair line fracture and takes some time to heal. 
 In the mean time taping technique is used for allowing the healing process and less movement in the rib. 
 Also doing simple breathing exercises will help improve muscle strength and reduce pain.

 Thank you for posting your query.
 Uncontrollable (or involuntary) head nodding could be due to partial (or focal fits). It is not a generalised fit, as you would have lost consciousness if it was a generalised one.
 Short duration of symptoms also favour the same.
 For further evaluation, you should consult a neurologist. You may require MRI brain and EEG for confirmation of diagnosis.

"What causes diarrhea while treating diabetes? I am a 53 year old male diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 9 months ago. I drink 4-10 drinks 2-3 times a week. But I have cut out the microbrews and mostly drink just lager beer now. I have had bad cholesterol numbers for years. I am taking metformin (1000 mg) twice a day. I am also taking Lisinopril and Atorvastatin. My diabetes is due mostly to my weight (5 6 and 248 lbs) and lack of exercise. I peaked at 269 lbs and have been cutting down sweets and doing more exercise. I had a hard time staying on track from Nov (242 lbs) thru Jan (252 lbs) but am now back on track, eating better and incorporating more exercise. My blood numbers are all good or trending in the right direction. My A1C went from 7.7 to 6.5 in 3 months, and my liver and cholesterol numbers are now just within their proper ranges. So my issue is this: about 4-5 weeks ago, I started having a solid stool in the early morning, a loose stool later in the morning, and liquid coming out 2-3 more times later in the day. I get fairly tired by the early afternoon and will take a 2 hour nap on weekend afternoons. I have my normal diabetes follow-up with my doctor in a month, but am wondering what may be causing all this diarrhea? -Dave P"," Hello,Welcome to Healthcare Magic.I have read your question fully and understand your concerns.Metformin at high doses can cause stomach upset – commonest symptoms are diarrhoea, nausea and abdominal cramps. These side effects normally settle down when taken in Slow Release preparation form. So, instead of normal (immediate release) Metformin 1000 mg, you could take Metformin SR 1000 mg.I am not sure since how long you are on Metformin 1000 mg. Normally the side effects settle down in a few weeks. But in a small percentage of patients, the side effects remain. In this scenario, the only option is to reduce your Metformin dose and add in another Anti-Diabetic drug.As you are eating healthy diet now, are you consuming too much fibre? This can also lead to loose stool.So, if your diarrhoea still remains on Metformin SR, kindly see your doctor for further evaluation and advice.

Dear madam you should ensure that your dad has some competent staff by himself who can manage catheter reinsertion . It is usually not succesful to treat cancer by medicines. HYpertrophy can be terated but cancer will cause urine flow obstruction sooner or later. Only surgery can help in these cases.
Catheter can help if there is no significant urine flow obstruction. And this obstruction must be managed as soon as possible.Sometimes catheter become useless and permanent solution is ureterostoma.

Thanks for writing your query.
 After reading your post, it seems that you are having your symptoms due to gastritis caused by excessive acidity and gas production in your stomach.
 You can take an antacid like Omeprazole 40 mg along with Domperidone once a day before breakfast.
 Following precautions will be helpful :-
1. Do not miss a meal.
2. Avoid spicy and oily foods.
3. Avoid smoking/alcohol, if any.
4. Avoid emotional/mental stress.
5. Do not self medicate, especially with pain killers and steroids.
6. Avoid gas producing foods like peas, legumes, etc.

 It would appear from your description of the paralysis and medications that you suffered a stroke in 2012. You've not really said much about how you are currently doing but my guess is that things are stable.  
 After 7 years from a stroke the paralyzed portions of the body will have reached a stable point of recovery. Medication wise, it would appear that your doctor is covering you for the correct and adequate items that could cause problems in the future such as cholesterol and it also appears he is giving you some type of supplementation for good health of the brain tissue itself.
 I might recommend your doctor look into your B12 and Vitamin D levels in the bloodstream. Those 2 things are very important to good nerve health following a stroke. I would talk to the doctor about doing blood work and looking for B12 levels that are no less than 450 and D levels that are 60-80.
 Otherwise, the balance of your medication list appears to be quite reasonable and I'd suggest it continue. You may also benefit from some form of personal REHABILITATION EXERCISE therapy depending on how paralyzed the right side may be and if your speech and language have been affected you may be able to benefit from speech therapy as well if you never had any in 2012.

"What causes mild joint pain and strained muscle in the shoulders? Good evening... I am writing about a systemic problem I am having with mild to severe join pain.

 As you have mentioned, one of the causes would be a radiculopathy. However, I think since the MRI is negative, another possible cause that needs to be ruled out is a neuropathy- an isolated single nerve involvement, called mononeuropathy.
 I agree with the testing of the MRI abdomen. However, I think you should also be tested with an Nerve Conduction study of all 4 limbs- sensory as well as motor. This may need to be followed by a nerve biopsy.

How to cure pain caused due to removal to wisdom tooth? wisdom teeth extraction on left side lower jaw third molar last week friday- I had a wisdom tooth that was erupted very marginally. it caused infection so I was asked to remove it. the gum next to inner cheek was cut and the bone was drilled and the tooth was taken out whole. non dissolving stiches were put in to be removed in 7 days.its been 6 days now and as I am allergic to tettracyclin and peniccilin i was prescribed 1 panadiene thrice a day after meals and 1 cataflam 3 times a day.. the pain was manageable and I followed post operative instructions to the letter. there was swelling on the cheek and jaw that peaked on he 3/4th day and caused considerable pain when trying to sleep as the pressure when lying down was too much and pain radiated towards the ear. inside of the cheeks also was swollen and yellow scars appeared from rubbing on my teeth which were painful. now the swelling has gone down but i am in pain and the jawbone hurts as well as a small stiff lump on the jawline remains which is tender to touch and there are increases in the pain from time to time throughout the day. can move the mouth though slightly uncomfortable when eating.mostly inner cheek hurts and the lump on the jawbone is hurting alot. is it dry socket? but there are stiches so there is no hole in my gums.  or an infection in the jaw bone?  please help as sleepless nights have become the norm...," Hi,Thanks for asking the query,      I would suggest you to consult to an Oral Surgeon and get a thorough checkup done take an OPG radiograph , to see if there is any broken left over tooth particle.Take a course of antibiotics and analgesics.Take lukewarm saline and antiseptic mouthwash rinses.Apply ice packs externally if swelling persists.Avoid smoking and alcohol consumption.Take care!","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"

Mild cerebral atrophy is a condition that causes some changes in the structure of the brain. Several conditions can cause a brain to atrophy, including diseases and ageing. hence this symptom is not a serious condition if it is mild, except that the patient might experience mild memory loss problems. cerebral atrophy is found in the majority of people as they age. It usually progresses with severity as a person gets older. what is more important than the presence of atrophy is whether the degree you have is appropriate for your age.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"
What should I do for severe back tail bone pain? I ve had tailbone pain for the past 1 1/2 years. I don t remember injuring it at all. The pain is more severe on days that I sit a lot. I asked my doctor about this and she pretty much dismissed it as nothing. Any thoughts on this would be great! Thanks," Hi Sorry to hear about your problem.You have a condition called COCCODYNIA. This is basically inflammation of the tip of the tail bone. The tip of the tail bone has a set of three very small bones with joints between them. People who sit for long periods of time involving perhaps, a desk job can transmit considerable pressure to the tip of the tail bone. Treatment involves sitting on a ring cushion with a hole at the centre of the cushion. You should sit with the tip of your tail bone on the hole and buttocks on either side. Also injections given at the spot can reduce inflammation at the point.Hope this helps,Do let me know if you have any more queries on this one,Dr Purushottam Reddy Padala MS(Ortho) FRCSConsultant orthopaedic and joint replacement surgeonHappy Joints Orthopaedic centre.

Why do i need to continue psa test even after prostatectomy ? I am 71 yrs old and had a prostatectomy 7 yrs ago. Why do I continue to need a psa?," Hello 
Welcome to healthcaremagic
 As PSA is producted by prostate gland and after complete removal its level should be around 0,you may be wondering why you need to get PSA test.
 If PSA level starts rising in post-operative patients it almost always indicate recurrence of disease. Rising PSA can detect recurrence even before imaging tests like a bone scan or CT scan are positive
 Classically , a PSA rise to 0.4 after surgery has been considered a recurrence.  Rises in PSA lower than this have been considered insignificant, possible due to some left over benign prostate tissue.  More recently, the value of 0.2 has been chosen.  
So be reassured and follow your doctors advise or PSA examination

 Thanks for sharing your concern.
 your history suggests that you have got root canal treatment done.which is still incomplete.
 please give me complete history,regarding your root canal.
 your present pain is due to infected canal and infected pulp tissues there, causing pain.
 It can be relived by pain killers temporarily, but you need to see your dentist soon ,so that infected pulp tissues can be thoroughly removed ,canal can be prepared and then obturated (filled) aseptically.
 Meanwhile continue with your antibiotics and pain killers.
 Do antiseptic mouth rinsing.

How to recover from the neuroma in the left forearm? I been diagnosed with a neuroma in my left forearm and it has been giving me a lot of pain. I have numbness and tingling along with burning. I ha have d noticed to lump a few years ago but never botherd me. I had a test done to check for nerve damage. it only indicated slight nerve damage. I have headaches and ringing/fullness in my ears. I have always been physical. I can no longer carry usual weighted items in my left arm as I could before. The dr requested a second opinion. What else wo uld cause this?," Hello. Thanks for asking from HCM.I can understand your concern. The neuroma occurs after nerve damage to heal the damaged area. So whenever neuroma occurs, it means some nerve damage. It can cause severe burning pain due to abnormal nerve regeneration. Weakness of muscle and sensory loss occurs due to nerve damage. The management of neuroma is either conservative or surgical excision and repair of nerve. Conservative management is indicated: If there is no or mild symptoms: Symptom of burning pain only which is responsive to painkillers like Pregabaline/Gabapentine/Amitryptiline  : Old neuroma of more than 2 years old with complete functional loss. Surgery at this stage usually does not cause any functional recovery.Surgery is indicated if: Intractable pain not responding to painkillers: Neuroma of less than 2 years with functional loss - Excising neuroma and joining nerve ends may lead to some functional recovery. But before deciding for surgery, nerve studies are done to find out the degree of damage, site of neuroma, affected muscle. You can correlate your features and consult neurosurgeon for further management.For headache and fullness in ear, it could be due to ear infection/upper respiratory tract infection, you should consult ENT specialist. After evaluation, he might prescribe painkillers, antibiotic therapy, decongestant, ear drops for 7-10 days.Hope it will help you. Thanks.

 The problem in the shoulder is generally pain and stiffness. If you have crepitus alone without pain, then continue all activities until the pain of stiffness becomes apparent. Crepitus alone - if not disturbing can be left alone.

I usually prescribe my such patients inhaled salbutamol/levosalbutamol to be used on as-and-when-needed basis for asthma symptoms. If symptoms are frequent, he may need inhaled corticosteroids regularly.2. If he has nose symptoms like nose obstruction, sneezing, running nose, etc, I would also add levocetirizine + montelukast to above treatment.3. Regular steam inhalation will also help him for nose symptoms.4. In general, I would suggest him to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes, cold air and air pollution as much as possible.5. I would also suggest him allergy testing for common air-borne allergens such as house dust mites, pollens, molds, insect proteins, animal dander, etc. This will help him to identify the substances causing allergies to him and also to know the measures to avoid them.6. Regular physical exercise including breathing exercise as well as a healthy nutrition rich in vitamins & minerals would also help him in a long run by improving his lung capacity and immunity respectively.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to him.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your father the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

If you lay down on your back and raise your leg, if you feel pain this could be sciatica, it is related to sciatic nerve. if you rest more by laying down will relieve. For permanent treatment do consult orthopedics. Now for cough take oral antibiotics and cough syrup, if shivering due to fever take paracetamol.Take care !","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 82, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}"
Could white strings in diaper of an infant be pinworm? My 8 month old has had little white strings in his poopy diapers lately. Could these be pinworms? I ve never seen this in his diapers before. He s also had projectile vomit a few times which is unlike him. He does happen to be teething. Is this coincidental?," Dear Parent,Many thanks for your question on healthcaremagic.com.  Your description does indeed sound like Pinworms.  These little worms can often be seen on the surface of the stool.  To be more sure, you may see other symptoms of pinworms.  They often cause the anus to be sore and itchy, so you may find that your son seems uncomfortable and has some redness around his anus.  If you check at night, you may even see some of the pinworms around his back passage. Pinworms are treated with a single dose of an anti-parasitic medication.  You should be able to get this from your family doctor.Pinworms do not usually cause children to be systemically unwell, so the vomiting is unlikely to be related.  He could have a co-incidental virus, or it could be related to his teething.  Ensure he is well hydrated at all times with plenty of fluids.  If the vomiting becomes regular or you are worried he is becoming dehydrated, he may need some more investigations.I hope this answer helps, if you require any further clarification or have further questions, do not hesitate to contact me.  If it has helped you, please rate the answer!","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"
"What does it mean by milk allergy test value 11.5 in a 10 months old? My daughter ( 10 months old) has milk allergy, she develops rashes all over her body if she takes milk or any milk product like cheese, butter, curd etc. She is ok with Ghee. We have got her Milk allergy test done and the value has come out to be 11.5 whatever that means... Any suggestions from ur side would be helpful..Thanks"," Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your daughter's history and would like to make suggestions for her as follows:1. I would like to know exactly how she was tested for milk allergy. At present, I assume her specific IgE levels for milk proteins are 11.5.The fact that she develops rashes after taking milk products also supports the diagnosis of milk allergy.2. At present, avoidance of milk protein (all milk products) is the best treatment of milk allergy. Milk products include all the foods/drinks that contain milk proteins like milk, curd, butter, cheese, paneer, ghee, milk biscuits, ice creams, milk shakes, dairy products that contain milk, etc. 3. Although she is ok with ghee at present, it is possible that she may develop rashes if she takes large quantity of ghee. 4. In general, she should avoid all animal milks. Some parents try other animal milk (such as goat milk) as alternative, but 80-90% of milk allergic children react to that milk also. 5. It is advisable that she gets breast feeding up to at least 2 years of age, as breast feeding is very good for immunity. However, her mother should also avoid animal milk & animal milk products as particles of animal milk can pass through breast milk and can cause reactions to her.6. As milk is usually important source of vitamin D, calcium & vitamin A, I would suggest her to take these supplements until she is allergic to milk.7. I usually suggest my food allergy patients probiotics supplementation which helps to improve food allergy & atopic dermatitis earlier.8. Usually milk allergy is a self-limiting condition and most of the children outgrow with age. So I would suggest you to consult her allergist-immunologist every 6 month or yearly who may perform food challenge test to decide whether she is still allergic to milk. 80% of children are free from milk allergy by 5 years of age.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to her.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your daughter the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 94, 'clinical_accuracy': 19, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 9, 'transparency': 9}"

Painful urination is probably from mucosal irritation caused by frequent voiding.

This need few lab tests like serum electrolytes, urine and serum osmolarity, renal function test, urine sodium & pH. Kindly discuss with a pediatrician.Hope I have answered your question.

Suggest treatment for painful lump on chest after treated breast cancer Hi. I had breast cancer 5 years ago . I now have a bruised feeling on the under edge of my bottom left rib quite near to the centre of chest. I sometimes think it feels like a mass or lump to touch. Last week I noticed a severe pain which made me cry out. It was very localised pain. It only lasted a second like I had pricked myself with something sharp. This happened 3 or 4 times in a space of a couple of days. Now it just feels bruised to touch under the rib just to left of sternum.," Hi,Thanks for writing in.It is important to do a clinical evaluation of the painful lump which has appeared after treatment for breast cancer. This lump might be due to an infection in the region if it is painful. Usually pain is there due to release of chemicals which cause inflammation. These chemicals are indicators of an infection which might be there in the area.A course of antibiotics might be required after clinical evaluation. Please take complete treatment and get any pus culture done to know the infection causing organism. Search other areas for any similar infection and also get it treated with medicines at the earliest.

"Lower abdominal pain, pressure on coughing, sneezing, sex. Intense rectal pain like lightning bolt. Treatment? I have two types of pain, and I m not sure if one is related to the other or not, if they are a gastro- intestinal problem or a GYN problem. The first I will discuss is the lower abdominal pain . Located in the center of my abdomen, right in the pelvic region, deep, not superficial. It s not even a pain really, more like an uncomfortable pressure. It never ceases, but at times its barely noticeable, and at other times, it s painful, but not sharp pain at all, but dull heavy almost-pain but isn t. Easy to endure, easy to ignore. Coughing and sneezing cause painful pressure. Sex is often painful somewhere deep inside, near my uterus. Almost never get constipation, usually have loose bowels and alot of painful gas... I have regular periods, which are medium / heavy flow with alot of cramping and passing blood clots, sometimes as big as dimes. My cycles have always been regular, except 2 years ago. I was also 140 lbs overweight (topped the scales at 270 lbs. on home scale), I was working and going to school full time. My periods stopped for about 6 months. Later, when I back on a normal schedule, and lost some weight, periods went back to normal. I have since lost 70 lbs. I also believe myself to have a hormone imbalance of some sort, cause I grow facial hair (lip and chin , male pattern hair growth), and quite a lot of body hair as well. I have to shave facial hair daily. I don t know if this info has any relevance here, but I thought I d throw it in anyway... Now for the rectal pain. It comes about once every few months. The only way I can describe it is like this : it s like having a lightning bolt shoved straight up my butt! A bolt of white hot electricity shooting straight through my rectum... It is so painful, so intense, it has literally knocked me of my feet, I was walking and I fell on the floor in pain. It hit me while I was driving once, and I remember lifting my whole behind off the seat and arching my back, and my foot stomped down on the excellerator and I couldn t move my leg to stop. I can usually feel this pain about to happen, it gives a warning, and I have to brace myself before it happens, or else I will fall. It s what I would imagine it feels like to be electricuted. These intense pains last about 10 - 20 seconds, and then they re gone for months, like they never existed, forgotten about until months down the line when hit again."," Hi welcome to Health care magic forum.

                                     You have got pain in the middle of the lower central area.hurts on sneezing, or coughing, or in sex.  periods are bulky,painfull. You got loose motions some times, and rectal pain. The rectal pain is so sharp like electric shock, and passes to the legs to get fall to the ground. For few months periods stopped, and resumed again. 
                                    You have also got masculine distribution of hair growth on the chin, etc.
                                    I suspect it to be the pelvic inflamatory disease, and can cause all the symptoms. 
                                     I advise you to consult a gynacologist for diagnosis and treatment.You may need to have M.R.I. besides other routine tests for confirmation. 
                                     Abnormal hair grouth could be due to increase in maleharmone testosterone in place of oestrogen the female harmone. for this you have to consult an endocrinologist. or you can get rid of by laser treatment.

On lying down it reduced but while walking the pain was terrible.Morning also little pain was there but it has reduced now.I also have headache now. Previously I had gastric trouble. Can you suggest some test to be done and also foods to be taken?"," Hello!
 Thank you for the query.
 Lower abdominal pain can be caused by several diseases including: urinary bladder infection, urinary bladder stones, uterine or ovarian infection, ectopic pregnancy, inguinal hernia and many more.
If your symptoms are associated with burning when urinating it can be urinary tract problem, if your pain aggravates when caughting and the pain is localized in one side groin it can be inguinal hernia. As the pain itself does not suggest any of these diseases, the very first step for you should be physical examination by your doctor. Fool blood work, liver and pancreas enzymes, pregnancy test and urine tests should be performed as well as abdominal ultrasound. Depending of the results of this tests further diagnosis can be planned. If you suffer also from constipation or /and diarrheas, blood or mucus in stool, lost of weight colonoscopy might be necessary.
 Hope this will help.

Is pregnancy safe during a high ESR level? Hi Am 29 years old. Last year i had an abortion and after this i am suffering from frequent leg pain. I am on ayurvedic medicines now. Recently i had a blood test and my TSH is 6.81 and ESR is 64mm/hr. My doc prescribed me Eltroxin 25 mcg. Now i am planing a pregnancy. Is there anything wrong with getting pregnant when my ESR level is this high. what should i do to bring my ESR to a normal level? will Eltroxin do any harm to my baby if i get pregnant??," Hi,Thanks for asking.Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. ESR level of 64 mm/hr is high and requires evaluation. Frequent leg pain maybe the cause of high ESR. Need investigations to identify cause. Repeat ESR after correction of thyroid hormone once to evaluate for other causes.2. Pregnancy is not contraindicated and you can go ahead. 3. No eltroxin wont harm the baby. Its a regular thyroid hormone. If you discontinue eltroxin, it could harm the baby. Make sure your thyroid hormone profile is normal, before your have a baby.

 Your sister should see a neurologist to further evaluate what the CT scan image may have shown.  
 An MRI of the brain would be a much better scan to obtain and if she is still having trouble speaking then, a speech therapist may be a good type of person to get your sister involved with since what you're describing may have been a stroke that affected speech and language.  
 If she is hypertensive and has a thyroid disorder then, she should be very careful to take her medications as directed and to check her blood pressures frequently to know whether the medicine is actually controlling her well or not.  
 If she also has a thyroid problem this could also contribute to some of her pictures so may wish to get some laboratory studies such as a free T4 and a TSH to check on the status of that particular problem.

Less than 5 minutes a rather large lump had grown on the top right side of my right foot, just below my ankle. How should I treat this throbbing aching pain and reduce the heated swelling?"," Hi,
 As per your history it appears that by saying sitting, you mean crossing legs and sitting. It is very common to have this after we age a bit, and the cause for it is stoppage of axoplasm flow in the nerves because of compression. This is not a disease but a common occurrence only that occurs with advancing age and with weight gain. Swelling is caused by stoppage of venous outflow while the arterial flow continues..the only remedy is to stop sitting by crossing your legs.

"What causes spitting of blood in the morning with high lymphocytes? Hi, past two days I saw blood when I spiting, but just in the morning. Between two mont I check my blood two time it show the same lymphocytes high then normal. My Docter said you don t have any complain. So it s okay. But this happen after I my saw my docter, now I m worried."," Hello, I will address your primary concern about the spitting of blood first. One of the causes could be a condition called bronchitis which is a type of inflammation of the lining of our large breathing tube or bronchus. This condition is usually viral and may show slightly higher lymphocytes on your blood count. Blood in the sputum or spit may also arise from the inflammation of the lining of the nose. These conditions are not serious and resolves. However one should also know that blood in the sputum can arise from tuberculosis or  cancer type diseases also which from your description does not appear to be the cause. However , my advice is that you should get a test called peripheral blood smear done . you must also obtain your test report on absolute lymphocyte count. Persistently raised lymphocyte count has to be investigated with additional tests such as flow cytometry and bone marrow biopsy. At the moment bone marrow biopsy is not necessary but you must get a peripheral blood smear examination done by a pathologist along with an absolute lymphocyte count done. You may also feel for any lumps in your neck and armpit . if there are any you must get investigated by a physician promptly.

Valium is not likely to help. Take lots of fluids. Avoid sudden changes in posture and make slow movements so that the body can adjust the blood flow.

Just check for any swelling or pus in that area or cavity in any near by tooth. If so, you need to visit denrist for its treatment.As you mentioned using baking soda. Its has good abrasive action and raise pH of mouth inhibiting bacteria but at times it can also cause gum inflammation.I suggest you to use a good toothpaste with baking soda rather then raw soda. Maintain good oral hygiene. If there is any plaque or calculus deposits, get oral prophylaxis done.Brush twice a day. Uss mouthwash. Do warm saline rinses.You can use Lidocaine oral gel on gums before eating. This will reduce burning sensation. Take good diet, multivitamin and minerals, spacially vitamin c, a, iron.Massage your gums with a gum paint. If inflammation persists or worsens, see a dentist.Hope the answer helps you.

 I am not sure you have provided the whole report. All the report describes the neck region and then in the end it concludes with saying simply gliosis in frontal region which is in the head, not neck. Anyway there is no need to treat/cure gliosis.

Causes can be many like trauma, stroke, infection etc, from saying gliosis only is not possible to identify the cause, may have been there for many years, even since birth.

In such cases, I used to send urine culture before starting antibiotics, reports of which will be available by 3rd days.

 You may initially experience short, mild attacks. But trigeminal neuralgia can progress and cause longer, more frequent bouts of searing pain.
 It's advisable to go and visit a Neurologist who might ask you to go for MRI Brain for a confirmed diagnosis and treatment.

 As this looks like a nerve root entrapment due to which there is radiating pain. I will advise you to strengthen the neck muscles, shoulder muscles, and triceps muscle. 
 This nerve entrapment can be considered as ulnar neuritis. And with the strengthening of the above-mentioned muscles will help reduce the pain.

"Suggest treatment for foot injury Hello, I wanted to know if I have infection. I had a foot injury about two weeks ago and I have swelling. Since yesterday I started having an itch and I wanted to know if this is infection. I have blisters on the top of my foot and I still have a lot of swelling and bruises."," Hello,
 An x-ray is advised for the safer side to understand the pathology of the bone if it may have got any damage. Because if there is not cut or wounds then the chances of infection are maximum less. This must be a bony hurt which may have damaged the soft tissues around it. Also, the mechanism of the injury may have helped us to understand the injury better.
 I will advise to hot water fermentation, do feet, toe and finger strengthening exercises which can be performed under the water and lastly to keep the limb elevated so the swelling reduces and the venous return is improved which will help the healing process to occur faster.
 But please make a note to take an x-ray of the foot in the AP and lateral views.

Constant right lower abdominal pain could be due to problems in your large bowel or could be due to PCOD related issues too. However we need to know whether your sharp pain is related to menstrual cycle or any specific day in your menstrual cycle; this could help us to analyze your issue in detail.       Passage of mucus with some pain could be due to large bowel problem; it would require further investigations like colonoscopy, for which you would require a formal gastroenterology consultation.

 One possible diagnosis is TRIGEMINAL AUTONONIC CEPHALGIA (TAC) of the ""ice pick"" or ""Primary Stabbing Headache"" type.

What causes lower back pain while walking? I get up in morning right side of lower back when I walk is diffacult also three finger on my left hand pain me when I grab hold of an object or bump them I know I have artharites I have total replacement both knees an both hips am worried about kidney cancer or bone cancer thank you," hi sir/madam,Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. Possible causes are-1. Poor Hip Mobility:-With every step we take our hip and pelvis move in three planes of motion.  If we have any lack of motion in our hip it will cause the spine to move more than it is designed to move.  Overtime this increased motion can begin to create inflammation and compression of the nerves that exit the spine.  This leads to sciatica and lower back pain.2. Limited Foot and Ankle Mobility:-Every time our foot hits the ground when we are walking studies demonstrate that the body needs to absorb 2-3 times our body weight in forces.  Those forces end up traveling up into the spine. If the foot is stiff and does not flatten when we walk like it is designed to do it will cause an increase in forces transmitted into the spine.  The increased forces cause increased compression and can irritate the joints and nerves in the spine.3. Decreased Hip Strength:-It is very common to see people walking with a slight lead to one side when the foot lands on the ground.  This is an indicator that the lateral part of the hip is weak (glute medius).  When this happens, the body compensates by leaning to that side.  When the body leans to that side is causes compression of the nerves on the same side of the spine.4. Stiff Upper Back:-With every step we take we also have an arm swing in the opposite direction. This arm swing causes our upper back to rotate.  If we have limited upper back rotation it will cause increase rotation in the lower back.  This increased rotation can lead to increased compression and irritation to the joints and nerves in the spine.5. Stenosis or Arthritis in the spine:-Research indicates that if you are over 55 years old, have pain in your lower back with walking or standing and it goes away when you sit, there is a 97% chance you have arthritis in your spine. This arthritis predisposes you to have pain with walking in your spine.  If you fix all of the things we have mentioned earlier then you can walk without pain even when you have stenosis or arthritis in the spine.  Don’t let it be an excuse.  Just know it is one of the 5 reasons why your back may hurt when you walk.Hope it was helpful.Stay healthy,Stay safe.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"

 kindly tell me if you are a diabetic? In diabetics, usually there is a condition known as frozen shoulder. it's painful in the early part of disease and range of motion also decreases with time.
 You need to have regular exercise and ultrasonic therapy from any nearby physiotherapy centre. It takes time to get relief but if no relief then you can get a local infiltration into your shoulder.

Thanks for posting your query. 
With the available described symptoms, there could be possibility of acute viral gastroenteritis or peptic ulcer disease. 
Relief in abdominal pain after eating suggests the possibility of peptic ulcer disease.
Myalgia is an integral prodromal symptom of viral infection. 
You should consult with internal medicine specialist and should go for thorough check up. 
You should also go for complete blood count, ultrasound imaging, endoscopy and serum electrolytes. 
You should take complete antibiotic therapy, proton pump inhibitors, antispasmodics, probiotics, antipyretics and muscle relaxants. 
You should maintain your hydration by taking potassium rich liquids. 
Avoid milk and all milk related products. 
There appears to be least chances of STDs.

Are heart rate variations a serious concern in a brain aneurysm patient? my stepson had a brain aneurysm five years ago and he is vent dependent and Is fed through a g-tube. He is also not mobile. requires 24 hour care. last night his heart rate was 39-40 and his oxygen was 99-100. His heart rate has never dropped and stayed that low. it will occasionally drop if he is cold but as soon as we put blankets on him and make him warm his heart rate goes back to 50 s.," Hi,
 There are other reasons that heartrates can become low and fail to correct and perhaps in your stepson, one consideration would be an infection in the bloodstream from either a bladder, kidney, skin or pulmonary infection.  Low heartrates that do not correct may be signalling a situation where bacteria have gained access to the bloodstream and are beginning to affect his hemodynamics.  
 If he is at home I would contact his doctor and have someone come out to take a look at him and consider getting some labs and/or other tests performed.

I also feel very bloated, especially if I take regular loperamide to slow bowel movements. The bulge is not painful but can be seen through clothes. It is round like an orange and seems to stop just next to my incision which is the length of my abdomen. Is this normal or should I be concerned? Am seeing my surgeon in December as saw him several weeks ago and hadn't noticed it the . Also is there anything I can take to reduce the bloating as the loperamide is effective in slowing and reducing frequency of bowel movements but after a couple of days I feel like I could explode, I am so bloated. Thanks"," Hi ! From the history of a major abdominal operation following which you have started noticing a bulge in your abdomen, an incisional hernia can not be ruled out. However, this needs to be examined clinically for confirmation for which you have to get yourself reviewed by your treating doctor.For the bloating which might be a side effect of taking loperamide continuously, you may try on taking some probiotic drugs along with a proton pump inhibitor, whch may help. WIshiing you an early recovery.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 7, 'transparency': 9}"

"Suggest treatment for choroid plexus cysts My 1 year old son has 2 choroid plexus cysts. Our pediatricians are not very helpful, as I believe they are not familiar with what to do since CPC generally goes away before birth. So I am just wondering what kinds of effects (if any) does/will CPC have on my son? I.E: hearing, vision, developmental, etc etc."," Hello,
 Choroid plexus cyst occurs due to a slight deviation in the development of a small part of the brain where brain fluids circulate.
 It is not so uncommon in children and its usually asymptomatic and detected incidentally. If there is no other associated congenital anomalies, then no need to worry. If any associated anomalies or developmental delay are there, then we need to rule out any chromosomal defects.  
 As you mentioned, usually choroid plexus cyst disappears before birth but rarely it can persist after birth. Ideally it wont cause any vision/ hearing/ developmental defects.
 I would suggest you to follow up with nearby pediatrician, especially to look for any associated anomalies and his development.

 It sounds to me like a compression injury to the rib cage. If the sound is persisting more I will recommend that on a safer note please take an X-ray, as rib cage is the area which isn't needed to be ignored in any way as it's one of the main areas of the human body.
 There might be a small hairline fracture due to the compression pressure which can be ruled out with the help of the physical examination and the x-ray.
 Meantime before you get this examined, use hot water fermentation and Basic deep breathing exercises to maintain the functionality of the pulmonary system.

The chelating therapy surely helps but not always (and not completely).If this is your case, then Voligbose might help with postprandial blood glucose but it won't target the source of your problems which is (presumably) insulin deficiency due to pancreatic destruction. If insulin is really missing you should take it regardless of the blood glucose levels to prevent serious complications like ketoacidosis.

I also broke my ankle when I was 7."," Hi, 
 You seem to have damaged the cartilage in the knee which causes pain and swelling. This also can lock the knee at times which sometimes can be released by popping it. 
 This needs to be diagnosed by an MRI and treated accordingly.
 Meanwhile, you need to avoid knee strain- squatting climbing more than a flight of stairs. You could exercise the knee muscles to keep the knee stable and strong.
 The ankle pain could be related to the fracture you had with an untreated ligament injury.
  This needs to be checked out too by an MRI. Please use an elastic ankle strapping during the day till you complete the investigations.

"Could lump in naval upto pelvic area with history of having bowel obstruction surgeries indicate hernia? Hello I believe I have another large hernia that goes from my navel almost to my pelvic area. I have had two previous bowel obstruction surgerys in the last two years. I was told that I had a tiny area at the navel that was thin but they could not work with it at that time. A week ago I was lifting my grandson and he weighs 35 pds and was carrying him. After that I noticed a lump and it has gotten bigger,"," Hello!Thank you for the query.Yes, this is very probable. Especially if the lump is in the scar area. Bowels obstruction surgeries give higher risk of wound infection or wound improper healing what can lead to hernia development. The lump should be more visible when standing and coughing.Now the question is if you need it to be fixed. If it doesnt give much pain, you may have it left as it is. Its because this surgery can cause more adhesions and cause another obstruction.Please consult your surgeon.Hope this will help.Regards.","{'score': 97, 'clinical_accuracy': 19, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

These reports will guide towards cause of the itching. Your doctor will be able to treat the cause. Also, if she is on any other long term medications, please inform your doctor and ask him whether they could cause itching as a side effect.For dry skin, I would suggest regular use of moisturizers  and take regular vitamin supplements especially vitamin E, zinc, selenium & vitamin A.Hope this will help you.Wish your wife the best of the health.Regards.","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"

Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.The abdominal symptoms described by you could possibly due to giardiasis, and/or amebiasis. However the selective weight loss in arms and legs or the dizziness might not be related to the abdominal symptoms. Some people do complain of dizziness associated with gaseous distension.If I were your doctor, I would send your stool for routine test for ova and cyst, advise you for a course of anti amebic drugs along with a proton pump inhibitor and a pro biotic which might possibly relieve you of your symptoms. Also you have to avoid eating outside specially fast and fried food.Go for lot of roughage in your diet with plenty of liquids.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

Thanks for sharing your concern.
 what do you think is the cause of his cheek swelling?is it just the bruise or the underlying tooth is involved?
 swelling of cheek indicates,trauma to tooth and supporting structures.  I would  suggest you to visit your dentist first regarding this,a vitality test for the concerned tooth will be carried out and then based upon the level of fracture of tooth (if any),treatment can be undertaken.
 later you can inquire about your other decayed tooth too,if adequate mouth opening is there and child is cooperative then superficial fillings( if any)can be carried out in the same sitting else you will have to visit later for that.
 His first priority should be the involved tooth and its suitable treatment.
 hope it helps.

Chronic Vit b12 deficiency due to gastritis, leading to pernicious anemia.3. Take antacids to reduce pain and also proton pump inhibitors. Vit B12 supplementation is also necessary to improve anemia and numbness.

"What are the symptoms of gallstones which indicate a need for a surgery? Last year after a scan of my liver, I was told I have gallstones.  I started having gut pain this evening, which is not a normal feeling for me & also belching.  What should I be aware of to know if there is a possibility of surgery in my near future?"," Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. 
I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.
 Please note that if gallstones are giving symptoms (such as pain or heaviness in upper abdomen after meals or nausea), then they need surgery. If gallstones cause inflammation of gallbladder then also surgery is needed. Silent gallstones are left unattended. Till surgery avoid fatty meals. If pain appear you may take antispasmodic as tablet Drotaverine.
 Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

"Suggest treatment for muscles and joint pain I m a 40 year old female who was basically healthy until a few years ago. I m wondering if you can shed any light on what might be going on with me. For the past several years, I ve experienced joint pain symmetrical joint pain in the lumbar spine, sac joints, knees and sometimes ankles and toes. There is no apparent swelling and Osteoarthritis has been ruled out. My thighs and calves often feel fatigued as if I ve run a marathon, when I haven t done anything to cause it. I run low grade fevers off an on, sometimes when I feel well otherwise. I also am tired all the time, sometimes absolutely exhausted. My symptoms flare and tone down. I have headaches as well as migraines. I have started breaking sometimes when I m in the sun. I also get pustules on my skin during the summer which look different from the breaking out in the previous sentence. My hair which has always been very thick is thinning considerably. My BP runs on the high side. My ANA is negative, my sed rate is normal. Drs have noted livedo reticularis, small fiber peripheral neuropathy and macrocytic normochromic anemia, but that s pretty much my different diagnoses, which don t explain most of the symptoms. I have had extensive blood tests. RBC morphology was abnormal (Anisocytosis slight, Poikilocytosis slight, Macrocytes slight) IgG was low, Uric Acid Serum low, Phosphorus Serum low, MCV high, MCH high, MCHC low, RBC Low. I have found the rheumatologists I ve been to aren t very open to possibilities when all the autoimmune diseases are ruled out, even though they do run on my paternal side of the family which consist of RA, Lupus, Takiatsyu s Arteritis, Sjogren s, Polyarteritis Nodosa, Addison s, and Hashimoto s. I would appreciate any expertise you can shed on possibilities to be tested or treated for. I currently have a neurologist 2 hours away and a Rheumatologist in that area as well. My Dr here will likely order any test I request.

Suggest treatment for fatigue and weight loss after fever 2 days back my baby (2 yrs) had fever and we gave her calpol syrup. But still she was having high fever. With consultation with a local doctor we gave her the Amoxylin oral suspension (Fightox) and her fever has gone. But she has gone lean and now became little bit inactive.," Hi,
 For fever for 2 days, you have started on antibiotic without blood test. Please don't do that. Get your child properly investigated and start on antibiotics.
 Weakness means is she unable to walk or general weakness? Please go to a higher center for subsequent tests to see total counts, HB blood culture and liver function test.
 Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

How to wean off Keppra and Tegretol? i have been taking keppa and tegrotol in combination for 14 years not due to epilepsy but due to brain aneurysms. I had an aneurysm in my left temporal lobe that was pushing on a portion of my brain producing the seizures. The aneuryms have been treated with cerebral stents and coils. I continued having seizures for a number of years after but have lessened over the years to a point I have not had a seizure in 3 years. Is there ever a time when consideration can be given to slowly reducing the dosage to a point where I am no longer taking these medications at all?," Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.
 Antiepileptic drugs usually are continued for at least 3 years. The decision to decrease or stop depends upon control and type of epilepsy. If you are having surgical management of aneurysm and seizures are completely controlled for 3 years, then gradual tapering of antiepileptic drugs can be tried under Neurologist supervision.

"Intermittent minor seizures, worsened symptoms with Torleva. Advisable to continue it? Dear Doc: I am in New Delhi, India, and have been having neuro problems for many years (present age 74). Over the past 3-4 years my problem has comprised minor seizures, occurring at irregular intervals - sometimes a gap of over 2-3 months, followed by 4-6 mini seizures in one day, again a gap, and so on. In recent weeks, my Neurologist has prescribed TORLEVA-500, one tablet daily in the morning. Using this medicine my problem has become worse. Even the RMI and RMA done at his advice have not revealed anything incriminating. Since 4-5 days, I have had 4-6 mini seizures daily, about half a dozen since midnight last night. Would you advise if I should continue TORLEVA-500, once daily, or would you advise a change in the medicine? In the past I have used DILANTIN , PHENYTOIN , or other similar drugs. Your early advice will be welcome. Thanks. J.C. Juneja in New Delhi. e-mail address: YYYY@YYYY"," Hi,
 Thank you for posting your query.
 You have provided a very good description of your problems. 
 Obviously, your seizures are not controlled with Torleva (levetiracetam). So, there is a need to change the drug (more so because you have reported worsening of seizures with torleva). Other options for you include Phenytoin (which you have used earlier) or tegrital (carbamazepine). 
 Normal MRI and MRA scan of brain is a good news.

This happens when the baby sucks at the breast very fast and in eagerness to drink milk will gulp in air too.

Do not put the baby in lying position after feeding till the baby burps out the swallowed air.2.

 Cold and cough are very common in children till 5 yrs of age. A child can get 10 to 15 episode of cold per year. I know it's very worrying as a parent, but most of them are mild self limiting infections. 
 When the cold lasts for more than 2 weeks or associated high fever with yellow nasal discharge, then it should be attended. Also when there is fast breathing, poor oral intake and decreased activity, then your child should be seen by a pediatrician.
 Now, for your child, oral decongestants like Maxtra drops or Phenergan can be tried along with frequent administration of nasoclear drops in nose (Normal saline nasal drops).
 If any of the above mentioned symptoms are there, then kindly show your baby to a pediatrician.

I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion you should consult pulmonologist and get done either fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC)  or transthoracic lung biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. For the diagnosis of cancer, tissue sampling and it's microscopic examination is must.  Without this, one can not stamp the diagnosis of cancer. PET scan can be false positive in infection. So only on the basis of PET scan, cancer is not confirmed. And you are having this opacity since 15-16 years. So less likely to be due to cancer.

I had an ultra-sound on the lymph node in November 11, result was normal. I have a light constant pain w/o touching the area. I clean my ears several times a day w/ q-tips, going deeper than I know I should, but it feels so good! Is it possible some cotton from a swab could be lodged in my ear canal and causing the pain?"," Hello,Your symptoms seem to be related to local inflammation or infection of the temporo-mandibulary joint. For this reason, I recommend consulting with a dentist for a physical exam and an X-ray of the joint. If an infection is present in the ear, it should be treated too. Hope I have answered your query.

Hi our baby has just had her 8 week jabs on Thursday she seemed ok the first night just a little grouchy, but yesterday and particularly today she is just not herself.

Hello Doctor, I had all four wisdom teeth removed 1 week ago and I developed a ""white-ish"" layer over the lower extraction sites a couple of days ago. Today I was eating sushi and I noticed that the white film is now gone and a hole is completely exposed. Is this normal?"," Hello, Thanks for writing to usOnce a tooth is extracted, the resulting hole fills with blood and clots. This blood clot is the matrix from which your body creates the new bone and gum that will fill in the space left by the extracted tooth. As this blood clot matures and becomes more fibrous, it can appear to have a white film or skin over the top of it. This appears as a white spot in the center of the healing socket. This is nothing more than new gum tissue being formed and because this layer of the clot is exposed to the saliva in your mouth, it becomes saturated with moisture, waterlogged in a way, and appears white. This is perfectly normal and will disappear as the healing progresses. Do not poke at it or disturb it at all if you can help it.

As per your query your son is having symptoms of fever which is due to impaired and reduced immunity of your body. Need not to worry about it. Take antipyretic drug such as paracetamol and along with that do tepid sponging in between depending on intensity of fever. Visit pediatrician once and get it examined to find out the cause of fever after thorough investigation. If required request your physician for any lab tests which may be required and start treatment as per that. You can take Crocin as well every 4-6 hrly. You should take Meftal P tablet as well. If symptoms still persists go for blood tests and then start treatment as per that. Avoid cold carbonated beverages. Hope your concern has been resolved.Get Well Soon.Best wishes,Dr. Harry Maheshwari","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"
What causes rash around mouth of my daughter? My daughter (3 year 9 months old) is getting some rash around her mouth. Her temperature is less than 100 degree Fahrenheit. She is active and normal except that she cannot open her mouth wide because of the rash.

It last a few seconds until it relaxes I try not to move."," Hi.Thanks for your query.Read and understood your history.Pain in the lower abdomen in a menopausal female person, on sneezing, coughing or moving in a certain way is most probably due to the muscle spasm, sprain in a particular muscle group. Once hurt, every movement of any nature does not allow it to heal. Another most probable reason can be a hernia. Very rarely an internal problem can cause, but then there will be sufficient inflammation that it will be difficult for you to move. I would advise you the following:First all get a physical and per-vaginal examination done by a Gynecologist to have a clinical idea what the problem may be. This is to be assisted by trans-vaginal and abdominal ultrasonography.This will prove the diagnosis and give a plan for further treatment.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.
 If no fever no cough no pain nothing to worry u can wait for 5 to 7 days. If not resolved even after 5 days or if size increasing, then you have to consult doctor for lymph node. Go for USG scan and FNAC. Most of the lymphadenopathy in children are associated with bacterial/viral infections called as reactive lymphadenitis. It will resolve after 1 week, so nothing to worry. If child has pain give Syp. Combiflam. If child has fever and cough give antibiotic Syp. Augmentin,  according to his weight.

I ve also refused to give him juice until he drinks his milk, but he would choose to go a whole day without drinking. Please help! Kelly"," Hello. Bottle weaning milk can often be very challenging with toddlers. Since your child already knows how to use a silly cup, it is simply a matter of no longer giving him any bottles at all. He may go on a ""milk-strike"" as you described and that's okay. You can feed him yogurt and cheese as alternate dairy sources.  To get him to drink milk, you can continue to deny him his juice until he has a cup of milk, even if he refuses to drink all day.  No child will ever dehydrate themselves to any point of danger when the drink is available for him.  Thirst is a powerful motivator so stand your ground and he will eventually give in.

                                      Thanks for calling .H.C.M.Forum. 
                                      You have got the smell of burning tyre from your air conditioner while it is working. First thing you have to do is get the air conditioner repaired, Because the fumes must be coming from the air conditioner due to burning of the wires in side it . 
                                      If it is left like that it may continue to emit the same. 
                                      As the fumes are of the plastic they will be thick in nature and diposited in the nose and bronchial tree, and cause irritation of the respiratory system. 
                                      You have got headache and  dizzyness , you would have inhaled more , it may be cleared in span of 1 hour, if you dont get relief , consult a physician. 
                                       Regarding children if they are free of any symptom you don't worry , usually late symptoms won't be there.

Dr s extremely limited here!," Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you should consult orthopedic doctor for your ankle pain. You broke your ankle before 1 year and still getting severe pain if you stop your painkiller. This suggest that either there is poor healing of fracture or there is nerve impringment (nerve in between two fracture segments). So consult orthopedic doctor and get done clinical examination and MRI of that ankle joint for the diagnosis of above mentioned possibilities. You may need re surgery for proper fracture healing.

For osteoarthritis of your knee.You need to continue cartilage protecting medication like chondritin sulphate [glucosamine], that you need to take for couple of months.I will advise to do X ray knee weight bearing and if required MRI knee can be done and if there is severe destruction of menisci then arthroscopic shaving can be done.Physiotherapy like ultrasound and tens will help, along with knee exercisesMild deformity can not be corrected with just medication,but further progression of deformity can be corrected.Exercises will help to strengthen muscle and joint. In lying flat supine on back – move your ankle up and down[plantar flexion dorsiflexion],keeping small towel below knee-press your patella[knee cap ] on towel and hold for 15 sec,lift your leg straight alternately [10-15 times].Lying on your tummy- flex knee alternately, make knee rotation in flexion.Sitting on chair- extend your legs alternately [hold in extension for 15 sec]Standing half squat taking support of wall to back..VISCOSUPPLEMENTATION: Hyaluronic acid injections given into the joint (especially large joints like knee joint) in prescribed dosages will give good short term pain relief in arthritic joints ranging from 1-2 years.Newer modalities for cartilage injury include autologous chondrocyte implantation[ ACI] which helps in treatment of cartilage destruction.Hope this answers your query.

This looks like viral illness. Sometimes when the fever is remitting there will be a lot of sweating. Nothing to worry about it. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day.

For this, you have to consult an surgeon and get clinically examined who may suggest you a few routine investigations along with an ultrasound abdomen.
The next possibility is food poisoning. You may get to have loose stools/vomiting if the infection is severe.
Next possibility is a pelvic inflammation. For this you have to get yourself examined by your gynaecologist.
The ultrasound will rule out if there is any calculi in your urinary tract which may also give rise to such symptoms. 
A diagnostic laparoscopy is an option if everything else fails to diagnose the problem.

"Suggest treatment for unresolved drilling pain in tail bone hi i had my cervex removed 5 years ago because of cancer, i woke from the operation feeling terrible drilling pain in my tailbone, thought nothing of it at the time as i assumed it would get better as i had had interference down there and thought it would dissapear in the healing process. 6weeks after my op  and returned to be told i needed to have hysterectomy (laparoscopy) because the cancer was found further up. I had the op leaving my ovaries 3months later. I still had this pain in my coccyx. 3months after my hysterectomy i told my consultant about the pain and he looked at my ovaries and said i was unfortunate and i had a cyst on my left hand ovary and that was causing the low pain in my coccyx. I had the ovary removed laparoscopy small incision above pelvis. The pain continued and i mentioned it every time i saw him. He referred me to a specialist who said he would not recommend anything and i am at my wits end now as i have just hurt my lower back some how and feel i am falling apart and i am just 50 years old. Please help!"," Hi,Thanks for writing in.The pain you are experiencing is most likely due to referred pain from the back. Such a pain might have originated due to nerve stimulated during or after surgery. There are many nerves which pass through the pelvis on their way to supply other areas and it is possible that mild nerve irritation might have occurred.The tailbone or coccyx area is not involved and only you are having nerve stimulation which makes it appear as though the pain is originating at that location. The cyst in the ovary if large in size then might have caused this nerve irritation. It is also possible that your lower back might be having degenerative disc changes. This might be investigated by doing a MRI lumbar spine if required after clinical examination. Please do not worry.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"

"Suggest treatment for thickened lung tissue with pneumonia in kids Hello, I have a question regarding my 3 year old son. About a month ago he was complaining that the right side of his abdomen was hurting a lot. We took him in for testing where they did blood, urine and xray and said he has pneumonia in the right lung towards the bottom which would explain the abdominal pain. However he was not coughing, no fever and even his pediatrician listened with a stethoscope the next day and said he sounds fine. I insisted on another xray which she did and then she appologized that she was wrong, and yes he has pneumonia. So he took amoxicyllin for 10 days, 6g twice daily. 3 weeks later we scheduled a follow up xray since she says that it takes a while to clear up. We did the xray and there was no change whatsoever. So now she says its probably not pneumonia and need to see a pediatric pulmonologist. The pulmonologist looked at all the xrays and says no pneumonia. He recommended a CT scan, whcich we did. Now he says good news, the CT is good, no cancer or anything however the right outer lung has thickened tissue. He says this could be due to a old infection and in any case he is fine. Now my question is is this thickening dangerous, will it pass and is this ok for a three year old. Also, what type of infection could have gone unnoticed by me earlier.

I want to release this problem. please give me the solution. please help me.," Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The jaw joint lock is because of the disc displacement in the Jaw joint or temporomandibular joint. This can occur secondary to long standing bruxism or grinding teeth during night time or it can be because of malocclusion or stress. Nothing to be panic, Consult a oral physician and get it evaluated. If i am your treating doctor, i would suggest you to take anti inflammatory drugs like piroxicam 20mg twice daily on first day and twice daily on next 6 days.

 By what you say I feel that your kid may be having a recurrent viral illness. I will explain to you how a viral illness behave so that you can be more confident.
 Fever of a few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. 
 If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days.

"Can Nutramigen be flavored safely for ingestion? Trying to get my son (1 month) to take his formula. Nutramigen A+ (Hypoallergenic). He can t stand it, and wont eat it. He was a premie and required surgery to remove part of his bowel (small intestine, 13cm s). We need him to eat this as he isn t gaining weight, but he won t. What do we do? Is there a way to flavor it safely?"," Hello, 
 From my understanding neither the company that makes Nutramigen nor parents who are feeding this formula to their infants advise adding a sweetener or other substance to this formula.
 This is most important.  Your newborn's intestines are very fragile and it would be unsafe to add other ingredients.  
 For example, adding sugar may cause different bacteria to grow in intestine and injure it further.
   You can ask his pediatrician about a different formula such as Alimentum which is also a broken down formula.
  Or perhaps a feeding tube could be passed through baby's nostril and down into his stomach to bypass his taste ability.
 Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

"Does continuous cycling cause hip bone failure? Hi. I know a person that is on a stationary bike every day for a couple of hrs, speed cycling.

As the pathology of the hip joint may be something different like the RA hip or the OA hip. Also, due to cycling there is more of the strain at the knee joint and lest at the hip. The hip joint may have had some past injury as well.Now since he has undergone one side hip replacement, I feel he needs more of the Strengthening of the hip muscles.

Asthma results in poor ventilation resulting in decreased oxygenation to the whole body and this is perhaps the cause of your headaches. Anyway, you should also exclude other reasons for your headaches like sinus problems, refractive errors etc. It is because of the asthma that you feel tired even after rest. Since you stay in a cool place at high altitude where the atmospheric oxygen concentration is lower, you can use a nebulizer for better relief. Also, steroid inhalers are needed to prevent attacks as they reduce the need for bronchodilators which usually have unpleasant side effects. Permanent cure for asthma is not possible but you can keep the symptoms at bay by avoiding triggering factors and taking anti-histamines whenever needed. You can try yoga and pranayama when when there are no attacks. Please consult a pulmonologist for further advice.

 As this sounds to me the weakness of the muscles of the hip and the knee. Usually, due to the weakness of the muscles, the joints become little unstable leading to popping sounds and etc.

 Your clinical situation and past medical history, it is important performing further tests to investigate your heart. In this regard, I would recommend performing a cardiac MRI. 
 If this test results normal, you should consider anxiety as a possible cause underlying your complaints. 
 It is also necessary checking vitamin D, vitamin B12 and blood electrolytes, coupled with thyroid hormone levels. You should discuss with your doctor on the above tests.

  this is unfortunate that your tongue got into the drill.
 It is good that he sutured it immediately.
 See normally we use non nylon MERSILK suture in such situation, which we remove in 6-7 days time period.
 As 48 hrs has passed, the primary healing of the area is finished.
but, you had written that some pus is there, please dont ignore it as it is a danger area, infection from here can spread very fast to the neck region and take a shape of ludwig angina, which can be  fatal.

 A prominent pituitary gland could be related to a tumor, to inflammation or to normal changes due to age (especially in teenagers). I would like to know your age.

 You child is been having fever vomiting and tummy ache. Generally, a medicine like Advil or ibuprofen causes gastric irritation vomiting pain in the stomach due to gastritis and even rectal irritation.
 I feel better to check her temperature using a digital thermometer in her axilla. 
 If the temperature rises above 100 F then give her Advil and monitor her fever. note the fever-reducing after giving the medicine, her activity in between the fever episodes, her appetite and diet.
 Preferably never give Advil on an empty stomach as this causes gastric irritation.
 Two give her soft diets fluids adequately like soups .ensure she eats small frequent meals with at least three to four times a day to reduce the gastric irritation.
 The pain in the anus seems to be probably because of the medicine or gastritis. 
 If the pain persists you can apply lignocaine jelly to the area to relieve her of the pain after ensuring her diet and fluid is adequate.

But today she is not atall eating anythng. Not even milk. She also has constipation from few days. Also she vomits on most days at night. Am worried coz she has hardly had anythng today & she s too cranky. Pls advise.", Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.I take this opportunity to tell you certain scientific facts and relieve your distress - 1. An active is a well kid even if she/ he is not eating well. 2. Development of a kid is as important as or I would say even more important than growth alone.3. As the kids grow their interest in food decreases and interest in play activities increases so that they eat small quantity and run away to play. As parents we need to be more patient and feed than less quantity but more aliquots per day.4. This age rather than the quantity of the food I suggest you concentrate more on the number of times you feed her and also make whatever you feed her calorie dense by adding good amount of ghee to it.5. I suggest you not to use appetite stimulants on long run as they may cause drowsiness.Regards - Dr. Sumanth,"{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 93, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

Diagnosis can  be confirmed by upper G I endoscopy , visualize erosion of gastric surface of stomach. Try raising the head of bed 4 inches above with blocks. It might also help to avoid eating or drinking 2 hours before you lie down. To help control stomach acid one should not drink alcohol or drinks with caffeine in them Avoid fried food , spicy food.

Teratomas are not the very common testicular type of tumours and could spread. However, before the operation is done, a clinical and paraclinical appraisal is usually done , to determine whether the tumour has already attained other structures or not. This usually helps your surgeon to decide on the appropriate treatment option after surgery, and the speed of installation of this treatment. I believe your surgeon must have done this before surgery, and the speed and invasiveness, type of treatment to be taken are usually based on these findings.
However, I would advise you to get to take your chemotherapy as soon as possible, for testicular tumours at times spread very fast, and during the spread period, are clinically silent with no signs and symptoms, revealing themselves only in an advanced stage.

However, if you need proof, I am afraid that simply contacting a neurologist, whether on this site or elsewhere is not enough, the diagnosis is confirmed through tests which can't be done online. So I understand your difficult situation regarding health insurance, but it is hard to prove anything without imaging tests like MRI. As for management it consists mainly of physical therapy and medication for neuropathic pain. After so much time it is doubtful that there would be any benefit from a surgical procedure (which again needs a MRI to determine whether there was any indication in the first place).
 Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.","{'score': 89, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 7, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"

 My uncle got some itching problem due to allergy type some doctor say due to food poision and some say due to tablets side effects later doctor has prescrb hyrax tablets and cialo lotion , but even using after 20 days there is no improvement, kindly suggest a proper medicine so that my uncle"," Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your uncle's history.In fact, there are so many causes of itching. Finding out right cause requires a detailed questioning and examination, also sometimes some investigations.However, from your current history, I would suggest you following:1. If your uncle has itching with urticaria/hives/skin rash, I would suggest him levocetirizine and montelukast daily for at least 1-2 weeks.2. If he has only itching, without any skin lesion, I would first think of dry skin and suggest him moisturizer application along with multivitamin and vitamin E supplements.3. If he is diabetic, please make sure his sugar is under control.4. If he has any other disease or he is taking any regular medicines, it is important to decide whether that disease or medicine is causing itching.5. If above measures do not help, detailed investigations will help.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish your uncle a quick recovery and the best of the health.Should you have any query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Regards.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"
"What to do for blister in child? Hi, my 3 year old daughter has a blister in the corner of her lip... they seem to be coming out on both sides, they dry and heal and come back again... thats been going on for almost over a month... I took her to the dr he gave her antibiotic but didnt work... Now I dont know what to do.. since it keeps progressing..."," Hi, welcome to HCM. Blisters on corners of lip is called cheilitis. Cheilitis is mainly due to multivitamin deficiency or superficial infection at corners of lip. Since, you have already given antibiotics, there is no need to give antibiotics now. In my opinion, you should give syrup bevon 5 ml two times a day for 1 month and apply Zytee lotion locally at the corners of lip. Since, our mouth is constantly in function that is why it takes more time to heal. It should take around 10 days to completely heal. I hope this has helped you. Take care.

"What causes severe upper abdominal pain? My husband has had stomach issues for 2 years now. When it first happened he complained of severe stomach pain in his upper middle to left abdomen. He also had a fever. We took him to the E.R. and he was diagnosed with Diverticulitis after a CT scan with contrast. Due to not having insurance at the time, we never followed up until this past month. He had a colonoscopy done and they found nothing to even suggest he has diverticulitis. They also eliminated Crohn s and Celiac disease. The only thing we have noticed that aggravates the pain is steak so he avoids it but still has the pain. He describes it as a bruised feeling. It s a dull pain unless he eats something that aggravates it or if the area is touched then it is a sharp pain, and he says it s not a cramping pain at all, just a very bad bruised feeling. It also causes him weird bowel movements that range from diarrhea one day to close to constipation the next. His doctor is treating him for Irritable Bowel but the medicine hasn t helped at all."," Hi.Thanks for your query.Read the history and understood the problems of your husband.

"What treatment is suggested for pituatary adenoma and PCOS? Hello and Happy New Year! I have been diagnosed with a pituitary adenoma (very small, around 3mm), and PCOS back in September. I've been on meds for these and since the meds started I have had no side effects, and my symptoms went away (biggest one being headaches with blurred vision, nausea and vomiting). Beginning of December I got a headache that didn't go away for almost 3 weeks. Also accompanied with blurred/cloudy vision, dizziness, and nausea/vomiting. The headaches have gotten better, but the cloudy vision has stayed. I had an eye exam a few months ago which showed that I had blind spots in my left eye, leading the neuro and eye doc to believe the adenoma was slightly pressing on the optical nerve. Problem is when I went back to my endo and neuro this past week and told them about the headaches, neither seemed to really care. I of course am concerned because I do not want to end up with permanent vision issues. Not to mention the headaches are not pleasant. I am due to deploy in the very near future and don't want to get somewhere and have an issue down the road. Is this something I need to push with my primary care doc and possibly get a new neurologist, or am I worried about probably nothing?

One of the side effects of Augemtin is antibiotic associated diarrhea.STOP Augmentin.It seems your kid is having viral diarrhoea. Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry.There is no need to use antibiotics (LIKE AUGMENTIN) unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your paediatrician).Regarding diet - You can use cerelac...any flavour will do.

 The pain, burning sensation at the operative site is a common finding. It takes almost a week to get through the pain. Nausea is an associated finding as well. 
 I hope you are on the right antibiotics. Please complete the course of the antibiotic. If you develop a visible swelling or pus discharge from the operative site, it needs medical attention. You need to get back to the operating doctor then.
 Meanwhile, you can take simple analgesics like Tylenol for the pain. Stick to bland diet and semi-solid foods for at least 3 weeks. 
 Take adequate bed rest. There is nothing seriously wrong with your health.

You should understand, that nasal polyps grow only  in inflamed tissue of the nasal mucosa. The mucosa is wet. During an infection or allergic reaction, the nasal mucosa becomes loose, swollen and red, and  produce fluid that drips out. With continued irritation, this mucosa may form a polyp.Although some people can develop polyps with no previous nasal problems,because they have hereditary tendency for develop polyps. often there is a trigger for developing polyps. These triggers include:-chronic sinusitis- bronchial asthma- allergic rhinitis-cystic fibrosis-Churg-Strauss syndrome with high level of Ig E-NSAID sensitivity (an allergy-like response to aspirin, ibuprofenThey checked your son for allergy and cystic fibrosis, in addition i propose to check him for infection and do throat culture for flora and sensitivity to antibiotic .

Doctor blew it off like it was nothing"," Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. There are many causes for hives. So more detailed history and description is required to give more specific suggestions.2. Parasitic infections, viral infections, bacterial infections can cause hives.3. Some conditions/normal activities like sunlight exposure, cold/warm water exposure, exercise, sweating, etc can also cause hives.4. Food allergies and food intolerance can cause hives.5. Hives can also occur due to adverse reactions to preservatives/coloring agents/flavoring agents etc in packed foods/outside foods, some drugs like NSAIDs (used as pain killers), some antibiotics, etc.6. In some patients, hives can be difficult to treat, like those with chronic conditions, autoimmune urticaria, etc.7. Stress can aggravate some hives.8. For treatment viewpoint, I would suggest you to take antihistamine like levocetirizine or cetirizine or fexofenadine for symptom relief.9. I usually suggest complete blood counts, ESR, CRP, thyroid functions, serum total IgE, urine and stool examination to investigate patients with repeated hives as first line investigations. If these investigations do not reveal any abnormality, more detailed investigations might have to be done.10. I usually also suggest my such patients a good multivitamin-multivitamin containing vitamin A, D, E, zinc, selenium, essential fatty acids, for 2-3 months which improves skin and immunity.11. I would also suggest you to apply moisturizing lotion/cream regularly, especially if you have dry skin.12.

                                              Pain in the right upper abdomen is suggestive of infection in the kidney, stones in the kidney, or upper ureter, infection of upper part of ascending colon. liver infection, or gall bladder stones. 
                                              I advise you to consult a surgeon for diagnosis and treatment. You may need to have M.R.I. besides other routine tests for confirmation. 
                                              Wishing for a quick and complete recovery.

 You likely comperssed the median and possibly ulnar nerve while asleep.  This can happen and if the body does not adjust itself because it is too DROWSY or FATIGUED then, this can be the result.  It is usually temporary, however, depending upon the exact position you had your arm and the part of the body that was compressing recovery can take minutes to hours.  If you still do not have full control within a few more hours after the writing of YOUR QUESTION then, I would get an appointment with a neurologist sooner rather than later to try and avoid facing a chronic situation of weakness and sensory alterations.  Also, try and figure out what happened that your body did not move enough (this is automatic throughout the night)....were you taking a medication that made you excessively drowsy, did you drink alcohol to excess which could've also caused you to lay overly still, etc. Try to correct whatever you believe caused your body not to adjust itself.

What causes severe sweating in an infant? HI my daughter is 9 months old and recently she is sweating alot while sleeping at night. the room temperature is fine. She sleeps right through although i am now having to change her nappy through the night due to leaking so im guessing she is urinating more than normal?, Hi.... excessive sweating with normal temperature could be due to day autonomic nervous system disturbance.

Do you think that this dry lip is from his breathing with his mouth open while sleeping at night?," Hi.Welcome to HCM..As per your complain it seems that dryness of upper lip along with fever can be due to dehydration while if your child sleeps with mouth open then it can be due to mouth breathing also as the mucosa gets dry due to continuous exposure of the mucosa to outside air..I would suggest you to first of all get him treated for fever, you can give him Acetaminophen but in case if the fever does not relieve with it consult a Paediatrician and get evaluated..Feed him with plenty of fluids and make him sip water if he gets up at night..Apply Petroleum jelly over the lips...Hope this helps..Regards..","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

 It is possible that your symptoms point to sinus congestion but they could also be the symptoms of a headache syndrome such as moderate to moderately severe tension-type or even migrainous headache.

What is the treatment for pain in tail bone? I fell two days ago. They took X-ray of sacrum and cocse and no fractures. However I am in pain by my tail bone. Iy hurts to walk sit bend squat cough etc. I place my right leg away from my body to get to sit without so much pain. What should I do next," Hello!Welcome on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that your symptoms could be related to coccydinia (which is tailbone pain). Usually it is related to a repeated trauma, an infection or inflammation, childbirth, wrong posture, or a cancer. Therefore, I would recommend performing additional tests to investigate for the possible causes: - a pelvic CT scan , examining this region of the spine and also the organs. - an abdominal ultrasound- some blood lab tests (complete blood count, PCR, sedimentation rate). Regarding the treatment, I would recommend trying acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Some tips would help relieve or prevent the pain: -Use a specially-designed coccyx cushion – these can be bought online and from some shops; they help reduce the pressure on your tailbone while you're sitting down.-Avoid prolonged sitting whenever possible – try to stand up and walk around regularly; leaning forward while seated may also help.-Wear loose-fitting clothes – avoid clothing such as tight jeans or trousers that may put pressure on your tailbone.- Apply warm and cold packs to your tailbone – warm packs include hot water bottles and microwaveable heating pads; cold packs are available as freezable gel-filled pads from pharmacies, or you can use a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a towel.-Try laxatives (medicines to treat constipation) if the pain is worse when you open your bowels – many laxatives are available to buy from pharmacies and supermarkets without a prescription.Physiotherapy may also be useful.

Thanks for writing to us. 
The pain in the back that you are having is not likely to be related to the seasonal allergies that you are having. This is more likely to be a muscular pain and is likely to subside on taking rest and mild pain killers.

                                          Your question is do you have to go to ER or wait till morning. I advise you to go today only to be comfartable till tomorrow morning.

 It seems elbow joints are damaged due to bone resorption. In such situations, instability is the main issues at elbows and hyper movements will affect the functions of upper limbs.

Could this be related to my connective tissue disorder?", HIGreetings from Dr.Divakara.PThanks for posting your query.     There is no direct relation to loss of consciousness and Ehlers danlos Syndrome ( EDS ).    What you had could be either a fits ( convulsion ) or a fainting attack ( Syncope). You need to consult a Physician who will do the evaluation to know whether its fits or Syncope as treatment is entirely different for both.     EDS can cause heart problems which in turn cause Syncope but otherwise no direct relation between loss of consciousness and Ehlers danlos Syndrome ( EDS ). Hope this information is useful to you.

 It seems to me that you have answered the question yourself. If the episodes occur when smoking marijuana then that is the most likely cause.
  Smoking marijuana may manifest with many neurological symptoms, phenomena like numbness and tingling are common sensory alterations associated with smoking weed.

Suggestions? 63 year old patient complaining of fatigue and shortness of breath, upper back pain and cough that has become productive the last 2 days. a chest Xray revealed pneumonia . rbc count is decrease, hemoglobin: decrease, wbc: normal, ESR: increased. Serum IgG is increased and both IgM and IgA are decreased. what is likely the diagnosis?"," Hi and thanks for the question,
The symptoms are very compatible with pneumonia. Shortness of breath, raised ESR and chest X ray findings. Hope an appropriate antibiotherapy has been prescribed. How ever, the low Hemoglobin levels have to be investigated. Low hemoglobin levels could be caused by the infection, but if very low, other causes should be considered.
Other tests could be quite helpful in doing this assessment. Serum IgG is an indication that the infection is chronic, But IgG measurements are however very non specific and we cannot be conclusive. Knowing exactly for how long she has been coughing is too important. A chronic cough might warrant sputum exams and a tuberculin skin test to be be done to exclude pulmonary tuberculosis. 
The back pain might require a spinal x ray, ESR, alkaline phosphatse levels, Complete blood count, serum electrolytes to exclude any bone malignancy.
I suggest visiting an internist with these ideas in mind could help min a proper reevaluation and management of your patient.

It is hard to find the exact cause. There can be spine metastasis, pancreatic disorder or degenerative arhritis.

The area is painful to touch as well.As seeing your symptoms what I can understand is to see two possibilities.1. De Quervain's Tenosynovitis2. cervical spine disc degenerative changes.As you mentioned that you are left handed by nature to perform all activities by left hand the above mentioned two provisional diagnosis comes in mind1. De Quervain's Tenosynovitis - A test called the Finkelstein test can help confirm de Quervain's tenosynovitis. To do this test, you bend your thumb down across the palm of your hand, and then cover your thumb with your fingers. Next, bend your wrist toward your little finger. If this causes pain, you likely have de Quervain's tenosynovitis2. Cervical spine disc degenerative changes - The Spurling's test (also known as Maximal Cervical Compression Test and Framonial Compression Test) is used during a musculoskeletal assessment of the cervical spine when looking for cervical nerve root compression causing Cervical Radiculopathy.Following this two test we can rule out one and diagnosis is close by. Also taking an MRI of the wrist or cervical spine based on the positive test either of the above will help guide confirm the diagnosis.Treatment -1. De Quervain's tenosynovitis - physical therapy can help you with the therapeutic ultrasound therapy, phonophoresis, TENS and exercises.2. Cervical Spine disc degenerative changes - Physical therapy with Ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy initially later performed exercises.I wish you a good healthfor more questions you can ask me and I will be happy to you.Regards.Jay Indravadan Patel","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"

Your question is not clear especially as you start with 'I had allergy' but dont tell us 'what to?'
Betnovate for face is NOT recommended for prolonged use and treatment for pimples with tetracyclines (as your doctor has recommended 'doxy') is standard care. If it is pimples or acne you are suffering from, then 2nd line treatment is roaccuatane that your dermatologist can prescribe but a blood count and liver function test needs to be done BEFORE starting this treatment.

I had an extreme weakness in my right arm and leg on Monday and went to the hospital but they told me that I didn t have a stroke . The symptoms went away and haven t come back. I did have surgery for a serious ear infection in July that (the ear infection) left the left side of my face paralyzed (hopefully temporary), my left ear deaf (again hopefully temporary) and dizziness (again hopefully temporary). I did go to the dizzy therapist on Thursday and did well that day. What happened to me?"," Hi,
 Thank you for posting your query.
 1. The extreme weakness of the right arm and leg could be due to a minor brain stroke- called as TIA (transient ischemic attack). In this condition, the weakness improves completely within 24 hours, mostly within 1 hour. However, there is a higher risk of stroke in future, if not adequately treated.
 If you have any risk factors such as diabetes, high BP, and cholesterol, they should be treated.
 In addition, you may also require blood thinners such as aspirin.
 2. Facial palsy, hearing loss and dizziness are related to ear infection, and they would improve over time.
 Best wishes,

Same with leaning over.i seem to loose my balance easily. Can this be something else and should I see someone?," Hi, welcome to our site. I am Dr Saumya Mittal, MD.Read your query. That is a very significant question and i appreciate your problem. I will try my best to answer your queryThis sounds very much like Benign Positional Vertigo. In this, if you change the head position suddenly and quickly, you will develop the vertigo.You need to be careful to change the position of the head slowly so that you do not have the sudden vertigo.The medicines are always there and are quite effective especially betahistidine. However taking medicines for a long time is not always a good way.I suggest you attempt to learn the Brant Daroff exercises, which are very effective in healing and improving the vertigo.An MRI brain would be good to make sure there is no intracranial or brain problem.I hope this helps you.

Thanks for posting your query.
Abdominal pain, dizziness, light headed and nausea suggest viral gastroenteritis.Howeverr it can be caused or later superimposed by bacteria.This highly contagious illness spreads through close contact with people who are infected, or through contaminated food or water.
Antibiotics do not work against viral diseases.
Drink extra fluids with and between meals.Avoid fruit juices.
Eat food in small amounts and let your stomach recover.
Get lots of rest.
Check with your doctor before taking medications and you may perform stool test.
Hope it helps.

Physiotherapy will also be helpful.3. Always keep checking your haemoglobin levels and specifically sickle cell levels.

I appreciate your concern.  I have gone through the details. Your brother requires best supportive care at this stage.

Welcome to HCM
You are having cough with sputum more so in night ,there is possibility that you have chest infection along with bronchospasm and inflammatory reaction ( Bronchitis).
I suggest you to visit a Physician who will examine you and this is very easy to diagnose and if required Blood count and X ray chest and Lung function test may be performed.
Then proper treatment of antibiotic,bronchodialators, steroids oral if required may be prescribed to you and you will improve in few days.
If Asthmatic reaction is there inhalation therapy is of great help.
You can always say which antibiotic you have allergy as there are many other group from which safe antibiotic may be given.
It would be unethical to advise drugs here without examining the patient personally.
Please visit a Physician you will be taken care.

      Firstly, you do not need to increase the monocyte count. Basically we find Monocyte as 1-3%. So, usually the level is very low. But, this report should be corroborated with the peripheral blood findings.

 Persistent sickness for how many days? Unlikely for a 16-year-old to get viral illness to cause that amount of sickness. Please go for blood investigations for her with total counts, CRP, ESR blood culture, platelets, SGOT, SGPT and urine routine. Consult a GP for further treatment.

"What causes seizures when diagnosed with elevated blood sugar levels? A relative is now hospitalized with seizures and an elevated blood sugar of over 1300. Has had recent hospitalizations with seizure activity. One doc said was not related to blood sugar. Another says, yes. Would a lumbar puncture be warranted to further evaluated?"," Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. 
 I would explain that uncontrolled seizures are closely related to high blood sugar levels. 
 I don't think that a lumbar puncture would help investigate for the cause. 
 I would just recommend trying to correct his sugar levels as soon as possible, because at these levels, the patient may fall into coma. 
 If seizures persist despite the normalization of blood sugar levels, then I would recommend performing an EEG and discussing on the possibility of starting antiepileptic drugs.

Suggest remedies for chronic stomach pain I've been having stomach pains for over the course of 3 months. I'm not taking any medications but I am on birth control..the shot. If I sit or stand for a certain amount a time then it begins to hurt. The pain seems to be under my left rib cage. I'm not sure if there's something wrong with my back or stomach. What should I do?," Hi ! Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.If I were your doctor, after an initial clinical assessment of your abdomen, I would advise you for an ultrasound of the abdomen with special reference to the pancreas to rule out inflammation in it which could give rise to such discomfort under the left rib cage. Also a routine CBC, a serum amylase and lipase would be helpful. In addition I would also advise you to avoid eating from outside to prevent any intestinal infection creeping in from outside unhygienic-ally prepared food. Avoidance of alcoholic beverages and smoking also top in your case if you do. A serum HCG might be indicated to rule out a pregnancy before going for an ultrasound. Till then you could go for an anti spasmodic and a proton pump inhibitor drug for a symptomatic relief.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery.

The different views on the CT scan helps the radiologist get a 3D view of the structures, unless you get the expensive 3D scan (not available in most centres) and ensure there are no polyps that are causing some of the symptoms.
 You will definitely require allergy tests either in the form of skin prick tests or specific IgE blood test to exclude house dust mite, pollen, mould allergies.
Long acting antihistamines with nasal sprays for 3 months provide a lasting benefit (also timing of the treatment is important to reduce the allergic symptoms), but symptoms in 20% of people.
Immunotherapy is reserved for this group and after 3 years of immunotherapy, one can expect a lasting benefit.

Thanks for posting your query. 
Do you have fever/ watery diarrhea/ constipation/ spasmodic abdominal pain/ nausea or vomiting?
With the available described symptoms, there could be possibility of acute viral gastroenteritis or peptic ulcer disease. 
Myalgia is an integral prodromal symptom of viral infection. 
You should consult with internal medicine specialist and should go for thorough check up. 
You should also go for complete blood count, ultrasound imaging, endoscopy and serum electrolytes. 
You should take complete antibiotic therapy, antispasmodics, probiotics, antipyretics and muscle relaxants. 
You should maintain your hydration by taking potassium rich liquids. 
Avoid milk and all milk related products.

 As the ligament is completely torn surgery might be the choice depending upon the choice. But for now you should stabilize the ankle in ankle brace. Do hot water fermentation and try strengthening the muscles of the foot and leg.

It helps my arm, but my back has not gotten better. i dont know what i can do to relieve the pain. help....please"," Hi
I have gone through the coplaints that you have mentioned in you mail & I think that the upper back pain that you are having can be because of para spinal muscle spasm or you can call it a sprain. It may have appeared because of some injury that you have sustained in the near past or because of some wrong posture. 
If the pain is radiating to extremities(i.e. your arms and legs) & you have a neuralgic pain then you should go for MRI to find out if there is any nerve compression or not.
 Just a simple tip to get relief, is to apply hot fermentation twice daily. You can take some Homeopathic remedies that will be of great help in getting rid of your problems.

"18 yrs old, lower back pain, bruising and red dots around shoulder joints. Any advice? I am 18 years old and have had lower back pain for the last 9 months. With no apparent reason for its beggining, the pain sways between mild and excrutiating. I have seen 3 seperate physio s for up to 2 months each, they make the pain go away and then for no reason it will gradually come back, and I will need to start seeing a physio again (none of them have been able to properly diagnose the problem) I have also started to get unexplained bruising and red dotes around my shoulder joints, and the joints themselves feel weak. Any advice? No one so far has been able to help and all the doctors do is give me painkillers", Thanks for the query. Persistent back pain in young age need to be investigated thoroughly.

 thanks for sharing your concern.
 gingival  abscess could be due to any of these.
 1.more commonly dental caries leads to periapical infection which then develops into abscess and forms the bumps on gingiva.(gum).
 2.improper oral hygiene,accumulation of plaque and calculus also leads to bacterial pocket upon infection.
 also some times systemic condition predispose to gingival abscess,like pregnancy,diabes,etc.
 therefore  i would say go for clinical evaluation once.
 it requires drainage followed by antibiotic and analgesic.
 meanwhile an xray would help to understand any pathology underneath.

I remembe being sore the days after, but since then, I have been getting some muscle twitching in my lower abdomen , mainly on the left side, although the whole area, left to right seems a little tight.

Thanks for writing in.
I think you probably pulled a muscle during the crunches. Its unlikely that the protected anal intercourse caused any of these symptoms. When you start with an exercise, please make sure you maintain a proper posture. Do not do more than 6-8 repetitions in one go. 
At this point, the pain can be relieved by using diclofenac gel and hot fomentation ( in the form of hot water bottle or electric heating pad). This should make the pain much better.

Thanks for your query
 Did you have such episodes before?
Do you have episodes of wheezing and breathing difficulty since birth?
How did this episode start ?
Are you having associated fever ?
How long this episode of breathlessness continues? or is it whole day ?
 Dont neglect and get a checkup from your  doctor. You will need the lung function tests, blood investigations and chest radiograph done.Culture sensitivity test of throat swab may be needed if its respiratory tract infection.
 Do warm saline gurgling 4 times daily for 5 days
take steam inhalation 4 times daily for a week
take Vit C 500 mg tablet once daily for a week
have plenty of fluids
take levocetrizine 5mg twice daily for 5 days [levocetrizine is considered a pregnancy Category B medication. This means that it is probably safe for use during pregnancy, although the full risks are not currently known .]
Take paracetamol500mg twice daily for 3 days and thereafter sos
 for breathing difficulty you may need salbutamol inhalation during acute attacks but its category C drug so proper data regarding its safety in pregnancy is not available.
 You may need antibiotics if you are having respiratory tract or lung infection.

You are right that it is difficult to put creans on large urticarial eruptions. If these lesions are red and itchy and resolve within hours but start again at different sites (part of body), it is most likely urticaria.
Triggers can be : physical (so do NOT scratch), cold/hot induced, stress (makes it worse), occasionally menstruation-related, but more commonly idiopathic.

 Cough and cold are viral 95% of the times in children. For cold you can use anti-allergics like cetirizine and for nose block, saline nasal decongestants will do. 
 Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (max ceiling dose 500mg) every 4-6th hourly, that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.
 For cold, you can use Cetrizine at 0.25mg/kg/dose every 12 hourly for 3 days. For nasal block, plain saline nasal drops will do, every 4-6th hourly to relieve nasal congestion.

This includes threats of violence, namecalling, sending insulting textmessages all the time etc. We understood her pain and let her rage thinking it would soon end. Then she started threatening Markus with suicide. A week ago she took some pills, end up in the hospital and blames it all on Markus. Markus is really broken up, he wants to help her. I understand his worry and pain but I think its not healthy for her to see Markus until she is mentally more stable for all our sakes. She has friends and family. What should we do?"," Hello,
 A patient with a bipolar disorder should receive an intensive treatment during the exacerbation, then the patient should  receive a prophylaxis treatment such as:
 Carbamazepine three times per day one hour before meals, he should start with half a tablet before breakfast for three days, then half a tablet twice a day before meal for 3 days, then half a tablet three times per day before meals for three days, then add half a tablet every three days before meals until the dose becomes one tablet before meals three times per day.
 Fish oil 1000 mg can be helpful for hem,he can take two capsules per week: one capsule on Monday after meal and one capsule on Thursday after a meal.
 He should avoid stress as much as possible, besides taking psychotherapy. The patient should do liver function tests and a CBC to assess the side effect of the drug.

 You have sprained your elbow and possibly minor fracture needs to be ruled out. X-ray of the involved elbow in anteroposterior and lateral views needs to be done. If X-ray is normal, muscle sprain is the diagnosis and splinting of involved elbow in AE slab for 2 weeks is required. 
 Tab Diclofenac Sodium twice a day for pain relief and tab Chymoral Forte twice a day before meals to reduce swelling should be started. Ice, compression helps in reducing pain and swelling. If X-ray is abnormal please consult an orthopedic surgeon nearby your area.

From your description , your sister seems to have advanced stage cancer. For cancer in hepato-biliary area the treatment are not that good and outcome is also not so good. Lets hope she benefit from clinical trial.
 Often overlooked treatment in advanced stage is palliative care.It  helps relieve symptoms, but is not expected to cure the disease. It can be given along with cancer treatment, or can even be cancer treatment. The aim  of palliative care is to improve the quality of your life, or help you feel as good as you can for as long as you can. Sometimes this means using drugs or other measures like physiotherapy etc  to help with symptoms like caugh pain fatigue etc.

Welcome to HCM
 Epilepsy occurs due to abnormal electrical discharge from brain areas. Most of the times in epilepsy MRI report comes norma. MRI is advised only to rule of any serious pathological cause of seizures. Even in idiopathic seizures EEG comes normal during inter episode time. Eptoin is phenatoin and is a broad spectrum anti epileptic drug. It is a nice drug and it can control seizures effectively. Apart from taking drugs please follow following advise-
- Never miss a dose of drug, if you miss a dose by chance then take it as soon as you remember missing it.
- Fix a time for food, sleep.
- Don't remain awake in late night.
- Don't watch television from close distance, avoid bright lights in night.
- Avoid loud DJ sounds.
- For some time avoid driving alone.
- Usually if you will remain seizure free on drugs for at least 3 years then gradual tapering of dose can be think of.

We go a puppy 4weeks ago we also treated her and worms came out in her poo I m at my wits end!!, Hi...I suggest you use Albendazole 400mg today and 400mg after 10 days for all people at home. Its better than Mebendazole. After you take the drug it will take some time for complete clearance of the worms. Do not worry.Regards - Dr. Sumanth,"{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"
"Nausea, wheezing sound in chest, congestion, lack of sleep, milk allergy ? I have a 3 month old grandson that lives with us and since birth he has had problems with vomiting . He has been given zantac , and it hasnt helped. He seems congested all the time, with a wheezing sound in his chest. He has been given a breathing machine for this and decongestants for the stuffiness, but still doesnt get better. Lately, he has seemed fuzzier than usual with a lot of discomfortant when feeding and after feedings. He also has dark circles under his eyes that look like he hasnt slept. Both his grandfather and father were diagnosed with mik allergies. That is what i think is wrong, but not sure."," Hi
 The short history you have given does point to allergy to milk. You could try stopping his feed and giving him a milk substitute formula like soy milk formula, amino acid formula, and gauge his condition. Also, milk allergy can be controlled with homoeopathy. You can consult a good homoeopath so that he doesn't have to suffer from this allergy throughout his life.

Thanks for query.
By doing self medication you are not taking medicine of proper dose and duration so problem persisted.
You might have taken Norfloxacilin-TZ of  full dose and for 3 days and your problem might have been solved.
Better you consult your doctor and have prescription of proper medicine.

Is swelling in front of leg with history of cellulitis and tender leg cured with antibiotics normal? hello i had cellulitis and my leg was at first tender and hot the i went to the M.D. and i took antibiotics and its now i its swelling in the middle of the front of my leg where it was infected it doesn't or i don't feel pain at all is that normal and how much will it take it to go ?," Dear patient thank you for the question.Your doctor will usually prescribe a 10- to 21-day regimen of oral antibiotics to treat your cellulitis. The length of your treatment with oral antibiotics will depend on the severity of your condition. Even if symptoms improve within a few days, it’s important to take all of the medication prescribed to ensure proper treatment. While you’re taking antibiotics, monitor your condition to see if symptoms improve. In most cases, symptoms will improve or disappear within a few days.In some cases, pain relievers are prescribed. You should rest until your symptoms improve. While you rest, you should raise the affected limb higher than your heart to reduce any swelling.Contact your doctor immediately if you don’t respond to treatment within three days after beginning a round of antibiotics, if your symptoms get worse, or if you develop a fever.Cellulitis should go away within seven to 10 days of starting antibiotics. Longer treatment could be necessary if your infection is severe. This can occur if you suffer from a chronic disease or if your immune system isn’t working properly.

I gave her Sinarest of 6.5ml which has following contents (paracetamol + phenylephrine hydrochloride + chloropheniramine + maleate + sodium citrate) combination from Centaur brand. Is it correct dose and the right medicine to continue for another 2 days? I will approach doctor if she won’t recover after 2days. Kindly suggest me right dosage and medicine. Thanks Prasad"," Hi,
 A cough and cold are viral 95% of the times in children. For cold, you can use anti-allergics like Cetirizine and for nose block, saline nasal decongestants will do. 
 Paracetamol can be given every 4-6th hourly, that too only if fever is more than 100F.
  I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. For cold, you can use Cetirizine every 12 hourly for 3 days. For the nasal block, plain saline nasal drops will do, every 4-6th hourly to relieve nasal congestion.
 I do not suggest giving Sinarest as it contains Phenylephrine which may cause a high heart rate and supraventricular tachycardia.

"What is the success rate of a reverse shoulder replacement surgery? I have had three shoulder surgeries on my right shoulder.

What is the success rate of this surgery and my expected ability to function afterwards?"," Hi,
 Reverse shoulder replacement is designed for rotator cuff arthropathy like in your case where muscle repair is not successful.
 It's a good procedure. Though you will never have a full range of motion, you will be able to do all your daily routine activities.
 You are 63 years and your shoulder will never have that strength that you had in your young age after any surgery. So you should have realistic expectations and you can go for surgery.

It is not clear if the path reports consistently said it was a liposarcoma. MRI is a good investigation tool for tumors and shows the size, location, infiltration and any associated structural involvement. The path reports are confirmatory and always have to be matched with the MRI results. If path reports say it was malignant then there is no other way to tell that it isnt one.In view of what is written above and considering that the path reports were altered subsequently, the appearance of a new tumor in the area requires CT or MRI scan and an image guided biopsy from the active region of the tumor. This is essential to know if there is a locally aggressive process going on and if it should be treated. The pain can be due to nerve entrapment by the tumor and that must also be looked in to. A biopsy is the final confirmation in your case. There is no need to get scared as it can also be a focus of chronic infection in the operated area.

This is an infection of the gut usually caused by bacteria or a virus . Gastroenteritis also causes diarrhoea.  ,can be rectified by modifying foods and life style .The most important thing you can do when vomiting is to keep taking small sips of fluid so that  you don't become dehydrated. Drink water sip by sips , lemon juice with salt and honey , diluted fruit juice or butter  milk. A sweet drink can be useful for replacing lost sugar . You may find that ginger helps to relieve  nausea and vomiting. Try drinking fresh ginger stewed in a mug of hot water. Aroma of crushed Coriander and mint leaves and taken orally with little salt and few drops of lemon juice  arouse appetite and is good for stomach Your immune system will usually fight off the infection after a few days.To strengthen your immune system  you need to modify your life style and food habits ,Eating the right kinds of foods before, during, and after cancer treatment can help the patient feel better and stay stronger.

My advise will concentrate the precautions based on phenytoin (of course, some of them are generalized precautions and can be followed irrespective of the medicine in use).Precautions are as follows-1. Avoid flickering lights.2. Avoid sign boards.3. Avoid blinking lights.4. Avoid driving.5. Avoid swimming.6. Avoid skipping medicines without medical advice.7. Avoid triggers of seizures (these are individual, and only a patient can know them).8. Take adequate sleep.9. Avoid stress.10. Avoid sleeping too late, or getting up too early.11.

I hope your son feels better soon and wont need any more surgical interventions .    From your given history your CT opacification of mastoid air cell means that these cells are inflamed with fluid or pus from his previoous mastooid infections and these cells are more prominent on his right side . this means that his air flow on the right side will be lower from that opposite side .   I think that means that your physician may prescribe antibiotics whether intravenous injections or syrup forms to decrease such inflammation and ear drops to help drain this cysts or inflamed cells .   In more severe cases or recurrent chronic mastitis your ear specialist may mention minor interventions like , small tube may be inserted into the middle ear to ventilate and prevent fluid from getting into the middle ear. Typically, the tube will fall out on its own after six to 12 months simultaneously without medications .

What is the treatment for hemochromatosis? I was having phlebotomies for eight years due to Hemochromotosis but my feritin has been normal for the past five years and the phlebotomies have stopped.  Does this mean I no longer have iron overload?  My understanding is that hemochromotosis is forever.  Last January my feritin was 38.," Hello welcome to HCM. I have read your question and understand your concerns. Yes . Normal serum ferritin levels means you have no iron overload. Usually hemochromatosis takes at least 20 years to develop after excessive storage of iron and phlebotomy is the treatment of choice. So, now if you have no cause for iron overload it will again take this much time to redevelop ideally. But as now you are aware you can take precautions to avoid iron overload. Do yearly basis whole iron profile and show it to your haematologist. Now you don't need any phlebotomy and you are cured of hemochromatosis but excessive iron load will damage liver and may cause diabetes. So Go for whole liver profile and blood sugar levels including HBA1c report. Thank you.

No other Walking or Sitting Position does this happen, only when in the Car after an Hour or so. Sometimes in the Right Butt, others the Thigh and/or Calf. Always on the underside ??"," Hello,
 As mentioned in history, I feel you are getting nerve entrapment while driving the car. This could be due to the weakness of the muscles of the lower back and hip. 
 That is where the nerve is getting trapped and the pain is felt in the hip, thigh, leg and foot.
 Having examined by an orthopedist should provide insight into the symptoms along with an MRI scan of the lumbar spine. 
 Usually, in certain positions, there is pressure over the nerve roots and this may lead to the symptoms you having.
 In my practice of 12 years, I have seen many CSR drivers complaining about the same symptoms. They all responded well to physical therapy.
 I will recommend you also the same, do some physical exercise for strengthening the muscles of the core, back, hip, thigh and legs. This should help you.

Blood thinners help to stop ongoing thrombosis but they don't affect the already formed clots. This is very important because an expanding clot can detach from the vessel wall and occlude pulmonary vessels causing life threatening conditions. With time, the body will absorb the clot and sometimes the vein can become patent again although not as functional as before the thrombosis.I hope I've helped you understand your condition better!If you'd like more information, please let me know and I'll be glad to answer.Kind Regards!","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 93, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}"

It tends to be more prominent at night and near my period. I have told my doctor about and have been checked for parasites just in case. I think I must be allergic to something. Could it be wheat?"," Hello,
If 3 stool samples for parasites have been negative, it is then quite unlikely. There are other surrogate markers on blood tests to check for allergies like eosinophilia on blood count or IgE levels (raised).
Allergies to house dust mite, animal dander (if you have pets), grass pollens, weed pollens (in asthmatics) must be definitely checked either in the form of skin prick testing or blood test (specific IgE test). A specific IgE to wheat can also be checked although very unlkely.
Do you get these symptoms after eating wheat products everytime? If no, then allergy to wheat is very unlikely.
Eczema and dry skin can make the skin itchy so keep it well hydrated and use moisturisers.
Long acting antihistamines will help and avoidance measures once the allergies are identified.
I hope that was useful.

For about a week, I have been experiencing a sharp, kind of stabbing pain in my lower left abdomen (directly next to my hipbone) when I walk or do anything that involves moving my torso.

Thanks for writing in.
Diabetes i.e. increased blood sugar level result in polyurea, a condition where frequency of urine increases. This can be noticed more at night. 
Please also have your HbA1C test done to check more details about your sugar levels.
Control your diet by restricting sugar and carbohydrates under medical supervision and get yourself fully examined and investigated accordingly.

Suggest treatment for severe acid reflux with rash on face of an infant My son is only ten weeks old and has been to the er three times. On Zantac for acid reflux very irritable still gagging. I also just noticed he has a blister on his foot and now has rash on his face with pimples. He has clear discharge from his eyes constantly. And also has been making a hiccup sound and twitching in his sleep. Please help me and my son Matthew," Thanks for posting your query at HealthCareMagic. Clear discharge from his eyes is not a cause of concern. The opening of his nasolacrimal duct might have not yet developed and a certain type of simple massage at the angle of eye and nose over a period of time will give him relief. For his acid reflux continue Zantac. But chances are that he is not being burped properly after feeds. Make sure that the child is placed in erect posture, possibly on lap, for about 20 minutes after each feed. In any case, keep his head end raised after feeds. Probably with such interventions his reflux would subside. The blister over his foot is probably unrelated. Apply emolients or moisturisers over the are. Hiccups and twitches during sleep are normal and you need not worry about it.I hope that helps.

My question: what is slightly inflamed and does it usually clear up on its own?"," Hi Jen,
Thanks for writing in.
An inflamed appendix means that this is redder and bigger than usual and is swollen. It may or may not clear on its own. The best assessment can be done only on the operating table once the appendix is seen. Usually, if there is a sign that this appendix can get obstructed, then the appendix is removed as it does not subserve any important function in the body.
Wishing you the very best for your surgery.

His preffered hand is always the left hand and is healthier than the right hand. The movement though of the right hand is acceptable by not as the left hand. The delivery was normal."," Hi,The prognosis depends on the underlying cause. Most common cause of wrist drop and arm weakness in babies is Erb's palsy (injury to nerves supplying arm muscles) during the time of delivery. This occur commonly following vaginal delivery, due to excess pressure or stretching of the nerves during delivery. Usually these children recovers completely in 2-3 weeks, but recovery may continue up to 4-5 months of age.
 After this age, complete spontaneous recovery is unlikely. Treatment is mainly physiotherapy and occupational therapy. Rarely, wrist drop can happen from fetal period itself(congenital), which is having guarded prognosis and less chance of spontaneous recovery. Your doctor will discuss in detailTake care.

 Thanks for the query,
 Let me tell you that in neurology practice, the MRI data must be correlated with clinical findings. It is the clinical data that is of paramount importance rather than MRI data. This MRI findings can be seen in patients with hypertension, diabetes also.  So we stress upon the disease that clinically evolves over a time. Further the symptoms that mark the onset of illness is very important in these neurological disorder. Parkinson's disease manifests as tremor, tightness of body, slowness of walking. The classic Parkinson's disease doesn't start with behavioral problem. Even though, the risk of Parkinson's disease in your husband is high due to family history, the current presentation is odd for the same. A possibility of front-temporal or vascular dementia is likely
Please get evaluated by a local neurologist

Thank you for the query.
According to your history ,the steel rod about which you are talking is a post core which is placed into the canal to support the teeth if there is no crown structure .
It appears there is infection in the teeth which has lead to an abscess formation .
I would advise you to take an x-ray and see your dentist .
May be you need to retreat the teeth by RCT or else if this had lead to resorption of the teeth then it has to be extracted followed by a course of antibitotic and analgesics.

 Asthma is a disease where there is  hyper reactivity of your respiratory tract to particular pathogen which could be an allergen , foreign body and infection.
 It may trigger asthmatic attack by narrowing your airways and you  may feel breathless/ breathing problem
 The medications your doctor has provided for you , one of them is primarily is to relieve you from recurrent allergic attacks and the inhaler is to  improve air entry through your hyper responsive air way so that you don't get any more breathing trouble.
 Follow your doctor's advice meticulously.

The only way the two- fall with head injury and memory problems- could be related is, if the fall led to head injury with brain damage, and you are now having seizures (post traumatic seizures). Seizures are known to adversely affect the memory.The way to go forward would be to get an MRI scan of the brain done. This could show any past brain damage (gliotic changes).Doing an EEG would help to exclude any epilepsy.

 Pain is not related to cancer. certain chemo has side effects like myalgia or musculoskeletal pain. you should have mentioned what chemo was given. mild injury not always needs antibiotic. there is no cotraindication of mox 250 with combiflam but may not be needed at all. clinical examination needed. consult your doctor.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"
Suggest treatment for fever and cold my kid is 4.5 yrs old and having fever for past 2 to 3 weeks but not continuously in between 1 week he was fine and now he got cold and fever temperature s 99.8 and i took typhoid test malaria test and urine culture and everything s normal and my son is active and he is very under weight 13 kg.," Hi...Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.Regards - Dr. Sumanth","{'score': 93, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"

"What symptoms would be a matter of concern when the head is hurt? My 14 year old son has a dandy walker cyst, vp shunt from a menengocele at birth. Very high functioning.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.
  Vaginal discharge is a common complaint in young girls before puberty.  Causes include foreign body in vagina, for example toilet paper; obesity; sexually transmitted infections, such as child abuse.  These causes, among others, MUST be eliminated by her health care provider.  AFTER this is done, she can be treated with warm baths 1-2 times a day with a mild soap like, Dove or Basis; careful drying between legs in front and applying small amount of baby powder(no talc); frequently change white, cotton underpants to absorb discharge; wipe front to back after bowel movements; no bubble baths or other irritants.  I do not think her coughing is related to the vaginal discharge.  Children can cough due to an upper respiratory infection, croup, pneumonia, asthma, reflux of stomach contents.

There need should not be any problems. But only thing is you need to be very careful about urinary tract infections.

Knee started to stiffen up and get more painful towards end of match, knee noticeably swelling and real discomfort on car home and painful to sleep, ache walking and stairs or kneeling painful...used price technique straight away..iced it straight away, tubrigrip compression and elevated..knee now feels better..widespread bruising tender on palpation of joint line/bruises, knee not as stiff but still an ache at end range flexion swelling has reduced. I think when the bruising goes the dull ache in my knee should go too, I feel I dont need physio or medical intervention as its only been 3 days since injury and to let healing process take its course? Am I foolish or should I check if ligaments/cartilage isnt Injured even though the symptoms/mechanism don t match? Thanks"," Hello, I have studied your case.As per your  history there is possibility of soft tissue injury in knee.Most commonly meniscus injury occurs may be associated collateral ligament injury. If pain persists then you may need to do MRI knee to see for any functional defect.As per your symptoms you need to do physiotherapy and knee exercises to improve range of motion.Rest and ice fomentation along with supportive brace will help to reduce swelling and pain.Small meniscus tear can be managed conservatively with physiotherapy with USG and TENS.Meniscus injury can be managed by arthroscopic repair.Hope this answers your query.

"Had appendix removed. Pain in operated area. Constipated, Taken codeine. Suggest? I m in a lot of pain. I had my appendix removed in hospital on Wednesday morning and was discharged Wednesday night. It s now Saturday morning and the pain in operated area is now worse and my stomach is very swollen. Could this be because I am very constipated and have not had a bowel movement for over a week and certainly not since operation due to the painkillers (endone) which I have been on which are full of codeine? What do you recommend I do about the pain and also the constipation . Would be very grateful for your advice. Thank u"," Hello,
Welcome to Healthcare Magic.
 I appreciate your efforts for medical consultation in so much distress.
Well, its already 4 days since surgery and presence of pain with not passing stools clearly directs the cause towards constipation, and as you were taking codeine as pain killer it also contributes to constipation.
Now coming to relieve this, I think you should start taking laxatives and if not relieved than dulcolax suppository may be required 
  Wish you good health.
