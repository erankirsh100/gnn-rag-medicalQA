"Hi doctor,My friend had safe sex and used I-pill later. Last month, she had her periods with a heavy flow and suffered from cramps. Is that menstruation or implantation bleeding?","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern. Menstrual irregularities could be due to hormonal imbalance caused by an I-pill. As your friend took the I-pill on time, there is almost no chance of pregnancy in her case. So she should wait for the next menstruation date, and get her home urine pregnancy test after seven days of her missed period date.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 94, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

"Hello doctor,
I have a non-painful, flat, red dot on the bridge of my nose. It is about the size of a pencil eraser. It does not ooze, there is no heat, and it is not textured differently from the rest of my face. The only difference between it and the skin around it is the color. I originally thought that it was irritation from popping a pimple in that area, but it is now three years old and has not gone away. It has not grown in that time either from what I can tell. I just want to know if this is something that I should be concerned with or have addressed?","Hello,

"Hi doctor,
Are triglycerides, lymphocytes, and ESR out of range? Please check and confirm whether any other values need to be verified.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Your cholesterol and triglyceride levels are high, which will increase the risk of cardiac and cerebrovascular disease. To reduce the risks, you can make some healthy lifestyle habits such as
1. Improve your fitness by doing aerobic exercises like walking, swimming, and running.
2. Having a low-fat and high-fiber diet.
3. Avoid junk foods and diets high in fat.
4. Taking Omega 3 fatty acid-rich foods fish fat - sardines, mackerel will help to reduce triglycerides up to 40 .
5. Drugs that help to reduce cholesterol are statins Atorvastatin 10 mg, Simvastatin, etc. and fibrates Fenofibrate 160 mg.
Also, your TSH level is on the higher end. So, If you have any symptoms of hypothyroidism weight gain, hair loss, cold intolerance, etc., you may need to take more of the drug Thyroxine 12.5 microgram. It is normal for your lymphocyte count to show some variations, and that does not require any treatment. Your ESR erythrocyte sedimentation rate is high, but it is nonspecific. It may be elevated in cases of infection or inflammation any skeletal muscular disease, lung pathologies, etc..
Consult your doctor and discuss the increased ESR significance.

"Hello doctor,
I am concerned about my mother. She is 49 years old, height 54 feet, and weighs 75 kg since she refuses to go to a hospital. She is been diagnosed with hypertension since her 20s. Her average BP is around systolic 130 to 140 mmHg and diastolic 80 to 90 mmHg. But there was a time when her blood pressure shot to 18095 mmHg. She was already checked with the doctor with all the laboratory tests that came back negative for any complications. Her blood pressure is sitting around 110 to 120 mmHg systolic and 80 to 90 mmHg diastolic since then. She keeps skipping her medications for one to two days. She got diarrhea and her blood pressure reading went up to 190120 mmHg. The problem is, she refuses to go to see a doctor and just took her regular medication which drastically lower her blood pressure in a few hours. Do we still have to see a doctor and have her checked? Kindly help.","Hello,

"Hi doctor,
I have hypothyroidism and Hashimotos thyroiditis. My doctor tested my TSH levels and treats me with Levothyroxine. I have extreme fatigue after taking this treatment for a year though my TSH is in a normal range. My doctor told me that freeT4 and reverse T3 are not important parameters to test them. I am afraid of whether I need to consult an endocrinologist or continue taking the same treatment. I had a TSH level of 9.8 mIUmL and it got down to 0.08. Now my TSH is in the range of 3.8 mIUmL.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Some people taking treatment for hypothyroidism still experience symptoms even if the blood tests show normal thyroid hormone levels. The reason behind this is complex but the bottom line is that a normal TSH thyroid stimualting hormone level does not mean that all your symptoms will go away. Evidence suggests that it is not uncommon. Levothyroxine is a gold standard treatment for hypothyroidism but many people fail to understand its physical benefits of this treatment. So try to reduce your TSH levels if you are still having symptoms. For this, you can increase your medication. If you are still symptomatic, then you can change the medicine of Thyroxine. You can try to take T3 supplements instead of T4.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 85, 'clinical_accuracy': 19, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hi doctor,
I have a strange feeling in my left testicle. I ordered a vacuum penile pump, and I used it only for two days. After that, I threw it away fearing an injury, as it turned my urine red. After five days, I went to a doctor, because I had a strange feeling in my testes, but I did not have pain. The doctor gave me tablet Diclofenac 100 mg and Cystone tablet. I started taking these tablets, but after two days, I have pain in my left testis and pubic area. I also had pain on the base of my penis and erection problem. So, I went back to the same doctor, who gave me Paracetamol and Nimesulide. I got a little relief, but after a month, I still have little pain. My testes are red, and I have pain in my pubic bone area. My erection is normal now. Is this because of the injury from the penile pump? I am attaching my ultrasound report. What should I do? Please help.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Thanks for your query. I have seen the attached ultrasound attachment removed to protect patient identity.
Your ultrasound suggests that you have varicocele, which is the cause of pain and discomfort and other symptoms in your testes and base of the penis.
In varicocele, the venous valve in and around the testis becomes incompetent or weak, and the blood gets accumulated in these veins, which get engorged. The pain is due to stretching of the nerve endings in walls of the veins due to this.
If you have discomfort and not severe pain, then it can be managed by taking painkillers and using scrotal support, so that your scrotum do not hang down. For severe pain, surgery is the treatment.
Thanks.

"Hello doctor,
I have had sexual contact with a sex worker for the first time. However, I am worried about contracting a viral infection like HPV or HIV. I have been experiencing fatigue and mild fever for the past few days. Should I get tested?
Please help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I went through your query and understood your concern.
If you are concerned about the possibility of contracting a sexually transmitted infection STI, it is always a good idea to get tested. However, HIV human immunodeficiency virus and some other sexually transmitted diseases can take some time to show up on a test. For instance, HIV antibodies may take up to three months to appear in the blood after exposure. So, it may be too early to get an accurate result for this particular infection.
Regarding your symptoms of fatigue and mild fever, they could occur due to many factors, including anxiety, stress, or a mild viral infection unrelated to STIs. However, I suggest you get yourself tested and consult a specialist in person.
I hope this has helped you.

"Hello doctor,
My ankle started hurting last week, and it has gotten worse, it is very painful and uncomfortable to walk. My question is, do I need crutches? I am a girl.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Looking into your problem it seems you are  badly in pain and looking for things can help you walk so you remember about crutches. As simple protocols use simple formula RICE rest, ice compression and elevation of your feet are key sutra. For severe sprains, you might  need a brace for protection and stability its good to use ankle brace having binder together in it. You may need crutches until you can walk without pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs can help to control pain and swelling. We need to evaluate ankle  with Grade II or Grade III sprains. Grade III sprainswith complete tears of the ligaments even might need surgery to repair the injured ligaments. One thing to remember is that always in most cases, follow-up rehabilitative exercises are  to restore strength and range of motion in the sprained ankle-also help to prevent future ankle injuries. If it is not healed ,think of doing X-ray of ankle, you might not know sometime there can be hairline fracture too stress fracture.","{'score': 95, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 5, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hi doctor,
I have had PCOS for over a decade now. I initially saw a gynecologist who tried oral contraceptive pills, microgynon, and spironolactone. She did a battery of blood tests and ultrasounds to confirm I have the condition. A general physician prescribed Metformin a few years back. All of the medications had little to no effect. Recently, I was referred to an endocrinologist and it was discovered that I have a missing 21 hydroxylase enzyme. Other tests were done but were normal. My cortisol was fine. However, my testosterone levels were high and it was found that I was indeed Insulin resistant.
The endocrinologist has put me back on Metformin 500 mg, three times daily and has requested that I return and see them in six months. I suffer from severe hirsutism, thinning of hair on the scalp, and obesity. Despite me being active and having a fairly good diet, it has been extremely difficult to lose weight. I cannot help but think that they have missed something. Can you have adrenal hyperplasia with insulin resistance? They have said no more to me with regards to the missing enzyme. None of the doctors seem to be able to treat my condition.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I just read your query and from what you have mentioned, it appears that you have a 21-hydroxylase deficiency and that causes an excess of testosterone and androstenedione causing virilization of females and PCOS. This is the cause of your hirsutism and insulin resistance as well. The treatment of Metformin is alright, but you also need oral contraceptives to combat these excess androgens produced. The missing enzyme cannot be replaced. Only the resultant issues arising from its deficiency can be dealt with. Since your cortisol was fine, the doctors are not worried about the missing enzyme anymore. Yes, you can have adrenal hyperplasia and insulin resistance together. Please try to exercise as well as to lose some weight as it helps with your symptoms.
Hope you find my advice of some benefit.

I am a female aged 21 years. I started my period a month back. I currently do not know the length of my period but it varies from 24-29 days, my last period was 24 days.

I had sex on the 26,27 of June and the 2nd of July.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Considering your cycle duration and ovulatory periods, the time when you had contact, there are a few possibilities of the etiology of bleeding.
1. The first one is that you might be having some ulcer or erosion out there in vagina or cervix which got further ulcerated when you had intercourse leading to painful painless spotting. If it is old altered blood, and it is coming out later, it will be brown in color.
2. The second possibility is that you may have some infection right down there. You might have acquired from your male counterpart if he has some signs and symptoms for the same.
3. Other etiology and rather a rare one, happens in 5-10 percent is that of ovulation bleeding. It happens once your egg is released from the ovary and due to some hormonal changes due to high LH or Progesterone, it may lead to spotting or bleeding which resolves in a few days time. The window when you are ovulating is the most fertile period, making the cervix secrete a thick mucous that might further hold onto the blood little longer over there and ultimately expel altered brown blood.
4. One more etiology for spotting could be implantation bleed, which is unlikely because it usually occurs few days after ovulation when if the embryo is formed, it gets implanted on your uterine wall, leading to spotting bleeding in a few.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

This is dysentery by history.
1 It will take some more time to bring the symptoms down.
2 You can go for a stool culture to find out the organism responsible for it. That would give useful information as to which medicines would be effective.
3 Look for an alternative diagnosis, but get an ultrasound abdomen to look for any obstruction or problem to the intestines. It is important to rule out this important condition which will change the management completely.

Thank you for the query. I can understand your concern. According to your statement, your daughter has been suffering from a fever, red swollen gums with bleeding, ulcer-like sores in the mouth, white spots on the tongue, a red throat, a blister on the lips. She has recently been diagnosed with hand, foot, and mouth disease. Hand, foot, and mouth disease is a highly contagious infection common in young children. It is caused by viruses called coxsackievirus. These viruses can spread from person to person through direct contact with an infected persons nasal discharge, throat discharge, saliva, stool, respiratory droplets after a cough or sneeze, etc. Clinical features of this disease are fever, chill, sore throat, painful red ulcer-like sores in the mouth or throat, bleeding gums, a blister on the lip, tongue, non-itchy red rash on the palms, soles, or occasionally in buttocks, loss of appetite, irritability, etc. Diagnosis can be made by clinical presentation and some investigations like throat swab and stool specimens which can detect the presence of the causative virus. There is no specific treatment, only symptomatic treatment. Applying topical oral anesthetic may help to subside the pain of mouth sores. Antipyretic should be used to reduce fever. Gargling with lukewarm water may help to lessen sore throat. But, according to the presenting clinical features of your child, your child may suffer from hand, foot, and mouth disease, and the diagnosis made by your doctor is correct.

"Hi doctor,
I am 31 years old. I had two miscarriages around 9 and 8 years ago. My last 6-7 periods were heavy and had a lot of pain. A lot of my family members had fibroids. So, I thought the same in my case too. Two months back, I got my last period, and as usual, it lasts 5-7 days, 28-29 days cycle. Last month I missed my period, felt unwell, had very sore breast that got bigger noticeably. Most of the time I had a nauseous feeling and became moody mostly sad and irritated, certain smells irritated me a lot, urinated a lot, started eating a lot, felt the need of eating sour things, weird taste in my mouth, my tummy felt full or bloated in a very uncomfortable way and I slept a lot.
One month back, I had 2 pregnancy tests, and both were positive, but the positive pregnancy test was very dark. I used the double pack of ultra blue. After three days, I went to the doctor for a checkup, they withdrew the blood sample to check the hCG levels. I got a call from the hospital asking me to come to see the doctor because my hCG levels are very high. Next day the doctor examined me and then did a transvaginal ultrasound, the doctor told me that the placenta is empty and it is not a normal pregnancy, but it is in the uterus. The doctor told me that no baby would be a result of this pregnancy and he also told me that my only option was the surgery where they remove the cells or tissues like scrapping the uterus. My hCG before the surgery was 28,671. I had the surgery on the same day. The nurse inserted 4 Cytotec pills into my vagina a couple of hours before the surgery. They said it was successful and they removed all of the tissue. They sent the tissue to the laboratory to test it. They said they suspect a molar pregnancy.
What is your opinion? They have not told me if it is a partial or a complete molar. It is 2 days after the surgery, and I am not bleeding a lot just spotting. Today I almost had no bleeding. I thought I am supposed to bleed more, should I be worried? I feel tired I have this weird taste still. My breasts are less sore, but they are not back to normal. Are those good signs? I read that this condition might develop some sort of cancer. Since my hCG levels were quite high to start with, does that mean I have a higher risk of developing cancer? If there were complications and the levels did not lower down, in this case, how strong is the chemotherapy? Will it have strong side effects like losing hair?","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have gone through your history and understand your concerns. I feel sorry about your loss.
It is most likely a molar pregnancy benign tumor developing in the uterus because hCG levels are quite high human chorionic gonadotropin and it is inside the uterus. Most likely a complete mole if the placenta has also involved. No need to worry, bleeding decreases when products come out and they are considered to be good signs. Sometimes, it can turn into cancer called trophoblastic disease. In your case, we have to go for a biopsy of the tissue and checkup of hCG levels after six weeks. If the levels are persistently high, then it is suggestive of cancer. Chemotherapy is quite effective in your case but the side effects of the drug could be there.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

"Hello doctor,
I am having a problem with my thumbnail. I usually wear fake gel nails. I have a habit of biting them off. Once when I bit my nail, the middle portion came off, leaving underneath of the nail exposed. It has been about three weeks. As the nail started to grow, it was growing out like a hangnail. I clipped it last night, and now more of the underneath is exposed. I believe the lunula is exposed. I have been keeping Polysporin and a bandage on it.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
The picture attachment removed to protect patient identity looks like a small bumpy growth. I am not able to see it clearly if it is flat or bumpy. For me, it looks like pyogenic granuloma. It is a benign growth made of small blood capillaries. It is usually painless but can bleed with minor trauma. It is hard to say if it is exactly pyogenic granuloma, which I am thinking of, considering the site. There has been constant irritation from the fake nail, which all favor the diagnosis. The treatment for pyogenic granuloma is the removal of the bump through electrocautery or radiofrequency. Another possible diagnosis is onychomadesis. It is the separation of nail from its nail bed. There are many reasons to it. In your case, I believe it is from nail trauma. Treatment would be to avoid using artificial nails until there is healing. Keep the area covered with band-aid after cleaning with Luke warm water.","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 73, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 9}"
"Hi doctor,I am a 39-year-old male with acid reflux. I am taking Phentermine 37.5 mg for weight loss. On Wednesday, I ended up getting my COVID vaccine.

Could drinking on an empty stomach cause gastric issues? I did not see any visible bright red blood or anything, but it looks brown. Kindly give your opinion.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Alcohol is the cause of gastritis, inflammation of the stomach lining. And it can cause nausea, vomiting, pain, and sometimes blood as well. Taking alcohol on an empty stomach has more of these above-mentioned symptoms than taking on a full stomach or fed stomach.
I have seen the picture you uploaded attachments removed to protect the patients identity. This does not seem blood. Although looking only at the color could not rule out that it is not blood. If you do not have any more vomitings, I suggest you keep observing and do not worry.
Alcohol is a nauseating agent as well. It also produces lots of gas in the intestine and hence can stimulate nausea and vomiting. I suggest you start taking capsule Omeprazole 40 mg proton pump inhibitor once daily before the meals once or twice daily for seven days.
Continue taking a good amount of water. I hope this will help you to get better soon.

Thanks for posting your query on this platform. From the information you have provided, it is possible that your mother has some sort of cognitive impairment or dementia.

I shot off my brothers gun ten times with rapid successions without ear protection. I have been having a ringing sound in my head and left ear for a week now.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Exposure to any loud sound causes some temporary threshold shift as far as hearing is concerned and might be associated with tinnitus. It usually takes around three to four days for this ringing sound to disappear, or it might take even a week in some cases. There is absolutely nothing that you need to worry about as this is a very common scenario we come across. If tinnitus is present in the same intensity after three weeks and if there has been no improvement, it is advisable to evaluate your hearing with pure tone audiometry. This should slowly resolve with time to come and is very unlikely to be a permanent issue. Please wear appropriate gear while using any ballistic equipment or heavy machinery as a rule for your safety. Hope this was helpful. Kindly revert for further queries.

"Hello,My three-year-old son is diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia 38 out of 65. As a mother, I want to know the reason for it. He is born with a small peri membranous VSD- asymptomatic. His nutrition is excellent- good eater, good quantities, meat and all vegetables. He is checked for the presence of intestinal parasites and reports are all negative. Hemoglobin, RBC, and hematocrit values are normal ,and have attached the blood and stool reports. The pediatrician ordered an iron supplement as a solution, but we still do not know the cause of this anemia. I am eager to discover the cause and treat this anemia from the base.Kindly suggest.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern.
According to my opinion anemia is not present because hHemoglobin and hematocrit are normal. In iron deficiency anemia it should be low.
Although serum iron is low, for iron deficiency anemia serum ferritin, serum TIBC total iron binding capacity, and transferrine saturation investigation needs to be done.
Here serum ferritin is normal in contrast with serum iron.
As target cells are present in the smear better to investigate for hemoglobinopathy by HPLC high-performance liquid chromatography study.
If iron deficiency anemia chances low is detected by other supportive investigation, then the cause might be poor dietary intake or poor absorption of iron secondary to some gastrointestinal cause. And even if no significant cause is found, then it might be because of the increased physiological demand for iron in the early childhood period.
I hope this has helped you.

Is beta thalassemia trait a serious case? Please help.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
We are elated to have you on board at icliniq.
Let me explain to you about the beta thalassemia trait. It is good that you are aware of using online health portals. Beta thalassemia trait is a heterozygous condition, and the patient can live a normal life. If nutrition is not maintained properly and if any unusual excess bleeding occurs due to some reason, then sometimes Hb hemoglobin levels can decrease, and the patient shall feel weak because of this. As such, thalassemia minor patients will not have any issues that shall hamper their usual lifestyle.
However, you have to take precautions while getting married. Before marriage, you should have your fianc checked for thalassemia. If she is also having thalassemia minor, then the chances of the baby having a thalassemia major are 25 . Thalassemia major is a dangerous condition. Hence, keep in mind that your fianc should also be checked for thalassemia minor before marriage. If you are not having thalassemia minor, then no further testing is required for your fianc.

"Hello doctor,
I have acne and acne scars on my face. I am using Salicylic Acid face wash these days. Can I use Salicylic Acid serum too?
Please help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Acne vulgaris is also called acne, and post-acne scarring appears in the form of depressions called atrophic scars or PIH post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. It appears due to multiple factors, including habitual picking of active acne, hormonal fluctuations, and gynecological conditions like PCOS polycystic ovary syndrome which may require an in-person consultation with a gynecologist to rule out their possibility. In addition, dietary modifications, climatic factors, genetics and usage of skin care products also cause them.
Since you are already using a face wash that contains Salicylic Acid and if it is effective you may continue the same. Salicylic acid serums may be too harsh on the skin in case of the presence of active acne. Therefore, taking medications and undergoing a few procedures may be beneficial, performed by professionals at their centers. So, I suggest you to follow the instructions mentioned below,
1. Use a face wash that contains Salicylic Acid 2  and Glycolic Acid twice daily, once in the morning and at night. Gently massage your face after applying the face wash in circular motions for one minute and wash it off. Do this daily.
2. Use Clinmiskin antibiotic gel. Apply it on the pimples after washing your face with face wash. The gel should be applied in the morning and evening daily.
3. Take a chewable tablet of Ascorbic acid Vitamin C 500 milligrams twice daily after food for two months.
4. Avoid oily and fried food, milk and dairy products, red meat, and sweets.
5. Drink at least ten glasses of water daily. Include more fruits and vegetables in your diet.
6. Avoid picking up the pimples to avoid scarring.
7. Acne scars can be reduced by chemical peels which are done in sessions at a dermatology clinic by a professional to lessen the appearance of acne scars. Laser therapies for active acne and acne scarring may also be done in sessions every month which is very beneficial. The chemical peel act similarly but is better than Salicylic Acid serum and may not cause irritation as compared to when done at home.
8. Acne may appear on and off till the late twenties.
Kindly consult a specialist, talk with them and take the medications with their consent.
I hope this was helpful.

Welcome toicliniq.com.
I read your query and can understand your concern.
First of all, do not remain distressed this thing can be treated. The inflammation can not run a long course. If you have no symptoms like pain in the penis, fever, or redness over the penis then the inflammation has been cured. No need to worry about that. Most likely you are having the problem of erection due to psychological reasons. Still, I would suggeste you to get color Doppler test for the penis to rule out the my vascular issues in the penis. Get serum testosterone and prolactin test done to rule out hormonal causes. If these things come normal then no need to worry. Most likely the problem is psychological. Drugs like tablet Tadalafil or Sildenafil croscarmellose sodium, hydroxypropyl cellulose, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium lauryl sulfate can be used to improve the erection in such cases.

"Hi doctor,
I have contacted many doctors but have not been satisfied with the solutions. I am a 27-year-old female. I had a sudden pain in the middle of my chest while eating. I drank water after I got scared, thinking it was heart pain, and the pain moved to my left arm. So I went to the ER, they took an ECG, told me it was normal, and gave me some medication. I was still scared, so I went to a gastrologist and took medication. I saw a neurologist for my left arm pain. They gave me medication because I mentioned chest pain, and they suggested I see a cardiologist. They saw the previous ECG, and it was normal. So they asked to take an ECHO test, and it was normal. Later, after completing all doses of medication, my left pain was still there. So, I went back. They gave an MRI and electric test, and both were normal. TMT was normal with 10.10 METS. So they said no issue with you. Still, I was having fear of death and a heart attack, as my mom had a heart attack previously, and she is fine now. I was consistently worried about going out to sleep alone and all, as I was experiencing pain, and everything was normal in reports. So I visited a psychiatrist, and he has given me two medications for anxiety and sleep better, one in the morning and one at night. But still, I experienced pain in my leg, arm, and chest pain, like pain from neck and neck crack many times, and pain in my arm and underarms. But when I crack, my arm pain gets better. Similarly, pain is there in my chest and sides of my breastbone, sometimes in the middle for a few seconds, and will go away within a moment, but it keeps happening frequently. So I am worried about heart attack or death. I am scared to travel alone, go out, or sleep alone. My heart always has a racing heartbeat, and consistently checking my heart rate on my watch, it will be 105 BPM, 114 BPM, and 125 BPM. Sometimes, when I do not observe, it will be 83 BPM, and so on. My sugar level is 91 mgdL, and my lipid profile is normal. My BP is 13080 mmHg, so could you please help suggest me the best I can do now?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your query and concern.
Did you undergo a vitamin D3 test? Did the pain worsen on taking normal or deep breathing?
I have gone through your reports attachments are hidden to protect the patients identity, and they are all fine. The first thing is that you need to convince yourself that there is nothing to be worried about and that these are unlikely to be cardiac symptoms. Firstly, the cardiac cause is less likely at this age in females and usually occurs on exertion and relieves with rest, which is not the case with you, and you get symptoms quite randomly. Changes would have certainly appeared on TMT treadmill test had it been cardiac pain. So, considering your symptoms and normal investigations, the probability of heart disease is very low, and there is a need to find alternative explanations for these symptoms. Regarding the probable causes, there can be multiple noncardiac causes for chest pain. Anxiety can also worsen the symptoms either by causing such symptoms or by heightened awareness of such symptoms. The first time, the pain might have been due to acid reflux the pain that occurred during eating, which has caused anxiety, so you became more aware now to pick such non-cardiac pain. Musculoskeletal pain due to muscle strain, costochondritis very common in young females like you and increase on pressing over the chest, and low vitamin D levels can cause chest and left arm pain. All these, except vitamin D deficiency, may not be picked on investigations. So, you should undergo vitamin D levels also. You might have become more aware of such random pain now. Sometimes, a viral infection can cause chest pain, especially if the pain is occurring during deep breathing. Such infections are self-limiting and settle in a few weeks. There is nothing to worry about a high pulse rate as it can be due to anxiety and lack of physical activities in life. You should engage in mind-relaxing activities like yoga, meditation, and regular physical activities. You should avoid oily, spicy, and heavy meals and have some walks after each meal.
Hope this helps you.

"Hi doctor,
I have been diagnosed with Globus and my throat and sinuses do not seem fine. I have seizures, and I feel like I have been poisoned after I had a drink with sore bones and blood. But I think it could be eagle syndrome.
Please help me. Thank you.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Thank you for writing and I understand your concern.
Actually, eagle syndrome and Globus both are different. Eagle is more painful and pain is more towards the jaws rather than in the throat, but in Globus, pain and discomfort are more likely to be in the neck region.
I suggest you do medical tests now which include endoscopic examination, x-rays, and physical assessment. So I would suggest you consult an ENT specialist. They will check your throat and let you know if you have Globus or not.
Do you have pain or discomfort in your neck?
Do you have pain in the jaw?
What symptoms do you have currently?
Are you taking any medicine currently?

Compression garments, customized ones to be worn in the area 24x7. Contractubex Extractum cepae, Heparin, and Allantoin ointment with a local massage to be done twice a day at the site of the lesion.

Your history suggests a Bartholin abscess or maybe a fungal growth. The growth actually needs to be seen before I can give you any coherent advice.

Good diet and exercise goes a long way to provide immunity against genital infections too. For relief, I suggest you start a warm sitz bath and avoid intercourse for a few days.

She did not have any other diseases apart from that. So, is there any chance for me to get lung cancer? I am too scared whenever I get a severe cough. I often get colds nowadays. My father and my mother are closely related my mothers father is my fathers mothers elder brother. Should I be concerned? Please guide.","Hi,
Thanks for trusting us with your health care.
I can understand your concern.
I do not think there is anything to worry about. The major risk factors for lung cancer include smoking, pollution, and prolonged exposure to certain chemicals such as asbestos, radon, petroleum, and more. If a first-degree family member is diagnosed with lung cancer at an age less than 50, it may sometimes be related to a genetic abnormality that runs in families. However, lung cancer at 85 years of age rarely poses a threat to other family members. So, do not worry. But if you are a smoker or want to undergo lung cancer screening, starting at age 55, you can have a low-dose CT computed tomography scan of the chest and repeat it every 5 years.
I hope this has helped you. Please feel free to reach me again, in case of further queries.

If it had been severe, I would have suggested only braces and not aligners, as I feel it might not be that efficient. Regarding your concern about the gap between front teeth, I assume you are talking about central lines or midline diastema.

However, if these treatments have not provided relief, it is essential to seek further medical attention. A gynecologist or an endocrinologist can perform a thorough examination, possibly including hormone level checks, ultrasounds, or other tests to identify the underlying cause of the prolonged bleeding.

"Hi doctor,
I am 21 years old. Is there a solution to the problem of my sperm leaking for the last 6 years?
Thank you.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Semen leakage is one of the male sexual disorders in which the carrier fluid of sperm, known as semen, slips out or leaks out of the shaft without an erection causing great frustration for the male. The basic cause of semen leakage is the overstimulated functioning of the parasympathetic nerves. The habit of excessive masturbation triggers this sort of stimulation. The parasympathetic nerves aid in keeping the ejaculation valve closed, helping a man maintain his erection during sexual performance. But over, stimulation weakens the nerves, and they can no longer keep the valve tightly shut. Consequently, semen leaks out.
When a man masturbates frequently, his parasympathetic nervous functions are stimulated, boosting the production of sex hormones and neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine. This boosting directs the adrenal glands and brain to make the body functioning highly sympathetic. In other words, the mans bioenergy is easily spent due to all these phenomena, and the problem of leakage in semen crops up. Therefore semen leakage indicates the exhaustion of a mans sexual energy. Apart from over-masturbation, the other triggers for semen leakage are stress, alcohol intake, steroid intake and smoking, and zinc deficiency.
The problem of semen leakage comes with side effects like excessive fatigue, hair loss, testicular pain, back pain, pelvic cavity cramping, weak erection, and premature ejaculation.
Cures for semen leakage
1. First and foremost, the man has to drop his habit of masturbation to get cured of semen leakage.
2. You can take herbal supplements containing a collection of miraculous herbs like ashwagandha, Shatavari, shilajit, safed musli, saffron, asparagus, and mucuna pruriens. These herbs are potent enough to nourish and strengthen the parasympathetic ejaculatory system. They not only enhance the power of the nerves but also that of the ejaculation valve, thereby forbidding semen leakage. NF cure capsules multivitamin, mineral, and fatty acid, and Shilajit capsules are effective herbal supplements for controlling leakage in semen.
3. Taking a high-protein diet is a good solution to the problem of leakage in semen. Include soybean products, eggs, etc., in your diet. Also, in plenty, consume nutty food items like sunflower seeds, and peanuts.
4. Refrain from taking caffeine.
5. Stay away from dairy products and red meat.
6. Check your habit of smoking and drinking alcohol.
7. Yoga and meditation release the pressure on the gonads and cure leakage in semen.
8. A therapeutic massage on the testicles with any herbal oil can help to minimize the problem.
9. Avoid wearing tight underpants to reduce the pressure on the testicular region.

Vaginal tears after sex are mainly dependent on several causes like vaginal dryness, chronic skin conditions such as eczema, psoriasis or lichen planus, etc., and sometimes it may also be caused by the use of recreational medicine like Viagra by the partner. Vaginal tears could be superficial and deep. Superficial tears usually result after having sex and they usually heal by themselves in few hours to 1 to 2 days and then usually do not bleed heavily. Deeper cuts usually occur during childbirth. As you mentioned that it took 10 days to heal your previous tear then it sounds alarming. Was there any heavy bleeding or pus coming through it? And how long have you been facing this problem? Can I have a look at any picture of tear?

"Hello doctor,
I am a 25-year-old female. As an important aspect of overall wellness, I am interested in understanding more about libido, factors that may affect it, and potential measures to maintain or enhance it. I have several questions and concerns. Please provide insights into the various factors that can influence libido. Also, provide information on potential reasons for a decrease or fluctuation in libido. You can also give guidance on lifestyle changes, exercises, dietary considerations, or therapeutic options that may positively impact libido.
Please help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com
I went through your query and can understand your concern.
Low libido has many reasons including,
1. Infections  It can be due to urine infection can do urine analysis and ultrasound of the pelvis to diagnose the cause.
2. Diabetes, hypertension - Make sure blood pressure and blood sugar are under control.
3. Hormonal disturbances- Low testosterone, low levels of thyroid, and high levels of prolactin can cause low libido.
4. Obesity - Plan for regular exercise and yoga.
5. High cholesterol  Check for lipid profile and plan for regular exercise.
6. Chronic disease or on any chronic medications.
7. Anxiety can also cause libido issues.
I suggest you do an ultrasound of the pelvis, thyroid check-up, and lipid Profile to know cholesterol levels. You can take a tablet of Mildfil phosphodiesterase inhibitor as a temporary solution.
Kindly consult a specialist, talk with them, and take medications with their consent.
Hope it helps.

"Hello doctor,I have a lot of anxiety. I sometimes cancel meetings because I do not feel adequately prepared. I am overwhelmed by noise and colors and thus prefer not to travel too far. Specifically, I avoid cities and crowded places. I feel disturbed not just by people, but also by perfumes, loud chewing, noisy phones, slurping, whistling, hooting, complaining, shouting, and delays, it is just too much. I fear rejection so much that I sometimes perceive it even when it is not happening. Additionally, I avoid calling clients back in case they are loud, angry, or I fear they might abandon me. I prefer texting, although I do not always open texts without mental preparation, fearing they might be mean or unfair. I fear abandonment calls induce anxiety because I often think people are calling to tell me they are leaving me. I have been like this since I left home at 18 to go to college. I am very untidy, and it seems like I mess up immediately after cleaning up. I can never find stuff or be ready on time. A few years ago, I burnt out and left the city to work on myself in a small town. I can hyper-focus and make lots of money. I am bright, creative, intuitive, resourceful, and highly qualified as a public speaking coach. However, I struggle to maintain a routine or structure for my coaching or business plan and to keep employees. I come up with a new idea or project every dayweekmonth, so I keep moving the goalpost, only to lose interest in both the project and the employee in a short time. It is affecting my work as a coach since I start meetings while still looking for pens, notebooks, slides, etc. Then I hardly follow through. The big issue now is I am not working at all. Today, for instance, I had low energy all day and just got a burst from 630 pm to 8 pm. I missed a meeting. I am feeling sad, angry, and bored. I did not even have food in the house because there was too much work to go shopping, noise, dirt, too many colors on buildings, hustle, and bustle, etc. I do not smoke or drink at all, but I have asthma and sinus issues. I am on a steroid inhaler daily and often on Montelukast, Levocetirizine, and occasionally Deflazacort or Prednisolone. I am experiencing work stress. My partner stole my clients due to anxiety she would take over whenever I could not rise to the occasion sometimes I just freeze. Eventually, she went behind my back and cut me out. I also do not know how to proceed or how to build the right team for my next action. Yet, I have been doing this work for 12 years, and it needs to be new each timenew business cards, new web templates, new office, new images. I am not motivated or committed to past successful strategies. I even changed my social media handles to start fresh.More work stress I want to move house, I move once or twice a year. I have closed my shop after three months and rented a different one. Additionally, I rented a garden studio to be a meditation teacher it is what has kept me going - meditation, especially by the river. However, I am not a patient person, and since only two people came for the first meditation class, I converted the room into an homestay. Now, I am thinking of offering kids public speaking classes. So, I am currently paying rent for four places that are relatively small and located in low-cost areas. I do not particularly like them, but I hesitate to commit to a larger, nicer place because I fear I will change my mind after a few months and want to move again. I feel ungrounded I have never had a place where I feel safe or at home. This lack of stability is exhausting. On a personal level, I am dealing with stress from losing my mum last month.

We need to evaluate in detail. First of all, please tell me how long you have been experiencing this problem. Was there any association with stress and tension? Do you have any smoking or drinking habits? Are you facing any personal or professional stress? While certain symptoms you mentioned may resemble ADHD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, we cannot make a diagnosis based solely on that. We need to conduct specific psychological tests to gather more information. Additionally, it is important to consider anxiety, as the symptoms you described are common in anxiety as well.

Thank you.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern.
Hormonal contraceptives have side effects, but it differs from person to person accordingly to their physical health, body response, medical history, and drug history. Every hormone, especially sex hormones, can affect the female reproductive cycle slightly or harshly in the short and long term. Use condoms and withdrawal methods, and avoid the fertile period at your convenience. But avoiding sex in the fertile period is also a better option. If you are having sex in a fertile period, then use condoms. You can have an emergency contraceptive in case of failure of the above methods.
I hope the information will help.

"Hello doctor, I am a 34-year-old woman and I have been facing irregular menstruation for the past four months and I have been having mood swings too. I get irritated at times and sometimes, I feel sad and depressed for no reason. Do I have any hormonal disorders? How do I find the cause? I would like to regularize my menstruation. Kindly help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I am here to help you get the best medical advice.
It must be actually very disturbing to have irregular periods and mood disorders. Irregular periods can occur due to a number of reasons like improper eating habits, altered diet, lack of exercise, changes in daily routine, thyroid disorders, stress, or weight gain. All these alter the hormonal balance and the menstrual cycle.
So, if you suffer from any of the above causes, then please get yourself checked. An ultrasound will help in checking the cause of irregular periods. Birth control pills might help in regularizing your period but that needs to be taken only if all the tests are done and are not significant. Also, I suggest you kindly do a urine pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy if you are sexually active.
Coming to mood disorders, feeling depressed has less to do with the menstrual cycle. Adapting to a healthy diet and doing your favorite hobbies will help you deal with the issue of depression. Also, you can obtain help from a psychologist.
I hope you got answers to all the queries that you had.

"Hello doctor,
I am a 62-year-old female with a history of chronic periodontal disease, particularly involving a pocket between teeth 7 and 8, which is associated with some bone loss and becomes infected every few months. I take fastidious care of my teeth and gums, including flossing, using a proxy brush and water pick at least two to three times a day, which helps to keep the periodontal inflammation under control. But, every few months, I have a flare-up of redness, swelling and sometimes bleeding with pus in this area in spite of diligent care. During times of flare-ups, I use hydrogen peroxide in waterpik, good germs designed specifically for gums and Peridex following cleaning. Sometimes, this regimen works well and resolves the infection. Other times, it does not, and I have to resort to having the pocket cleaned out using Cavitron ultrasonic and treated with Arestin Minocycline 0.1  antibiotic gel by my periodontist.
I started having symptoms of pressure and mild pain in and around tooth 8 about two days ago. I guess these symptoms to be the beginning of infection. There is no redness, swelling or abscess of the gum at this point. I do not want to lose the tooth, so I am very concerned to treat this infection early but, I am concerned about using the antibiotic gel too much and creating a resistant superbug. The X-ray consistently shows a large pocket between 7 and 8 with some bone loss. I am unable to post the X-ray here. The tooth is intact. The pocket was treated using Arestin Minocycline 0.1  antibiotic by placing it in the pocket on several occasions since five years with in-between gaps of one to two years. Otherwise, it is managed with my daily hygiene regimen, regular hygienist cleanings every two months, including using Cavitron ultrasonic to clean out the pocket, and, use of Hydrogen peroxide, good germs, and, Peridex during flares. My questions for you are
I am concerned about developing a superbug in my mouth i.e., antibiotic-resistance from frequent use of the Arestin antibiotic gel in that pocket. How dangerous would that be?
What is the likelihood such a resistant bacteria is created? Is there anything you can do about it?
In the situation where the gum gets infected to the degree I need to get an antibiotic gel put on by the periodontist, would oral antibiotics be preferable or more effective? How effective would oral antibiotics be for this?
Would a root canal help to reduce the problem of ongoing, repeated infections in regards to the gum disease? Or would that be irrelevant to the gum disease?","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
The antibiotic resistance is not a big issue as such, but I would suggest to not apply antibiotic gel more than two weeks with one or two months gap in between. Using warm salt water gargle twice a day is more than enough for good hygiene of gums. Root canal treatment will not help much in resolving gum infection as such but will stop any toothache or sensitivity you might be having in the concerned tooth. The X-ray which you have attached suggests a ceramic bridge which is placed to replace a missing tooth attachment removed to protect patient identity, but root canal treatment has not been done for the supporting two teeth. It is better to get them root canal treated to prevent any mobility of those teeth and to get added strength by ankylosis of the roots to the bone. And if the gum infection is around that bridge then it is highly recommended to get them root canal treated for more strength. Chlorhexidine antibiotic gel or even Metrogyl Metronidazole, if available there, is good enough for a local application. Continue with mild Hydrogen peroxide gargle or salt water I recommend and scaling of your teeth and gums once in six months.","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 93, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

From childhood, I have been masturbating by squeezing my thighs together and using pressure to get pleasure. Lately, I came across a condition called uterine prolapse, and I was worried if I can get uterine prolapse because I apply pressure during masturbation I have pelvic floor cramps after masturbation. Kindly give your opinion.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Squeezing thighs to masturbate is a very common and safe method. When thighs are squeezed together, there is pressure on the clitoris, which acts as clitoral stimulation. This leads to orgasm stimulation of nerves. There is no connection between the clitoris and the uterus and pelvic floor and subsequently uterine prolapse. The uterus is deep within your pelvic and supported by very strong ligaments, one of them being the pelvic floor. Uterine prolapse occurs if there is
1 Weakening of the pelvic supports.
2 Increase in intra abdominal pressure obesity, any tumor, excessive coughing, etc..
So do not worry. You are not affecting your uterus in any way. Also, pain or cramping you feel post-orgasm is a normal phenomenon and is due to the relaxing of your muscles. So stay stress-free.

"Hi doctor,
I have been experiencing pain in my upper abdomen and the left side of my stomach for the past three days. I have frequent sharp pains that are extremely uncomfortable to handle. I also have a sore throat and keep getting headaches. I am currently taking Prozac. What could be the cause of this condition? Please help.
Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have read your query, and I can understand your concern.
The cause of your condition could be acidity or gastritis. Do you have nausea, bloating, burping, pain during food intake, sour feelings in the throat, or chest burning? If present, they are indicative of gastritis. I suggest the following steps
Avoid consuming fatty, oily, and spicy food.
Walk after having food instead of taking rest.
Have multiple small meals instead of heavy meals.
Maintain regular sleep habits and avoid stress.
Eat lots of green leafy vegetables and fruits.
Avoid smoking and alcohol.
I suggest the following medications. Consult a specialist doctor, and take these medications with their consent.
Take tablet Pan DSR 40 mg Pantoprazole and Domperidone or Esomeprazole and Domperidone combination drug before breakfast once a day for two weeks.
If not adequately relieved, then you should take syrup Sucral O Sucralfate and Oxetacaine or Gelusil Aluminum hydroxide, Magnesium hydroxide, and Simethicone two teaspoons three times a day for a week.
For immediate pain relief, you can have antispasmodics like the tablet Dicyclomine 20 mg or Hyoscyamine 10 mg whenever needed up to three times a day.
I hope this information will help you.
Thank you.","{'score': 89, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 79, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 8}"

Mostly they are painless. I need an effective cure. I have attached a relevant picture. I have been using aloe vera gel now.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have gone through your history and attached photograph attachment removed to protect patient identity.
You should continue with Dermadew acne soap but stop using aloe vera gel. Besides this, you need oral as well as topical medications for your acne. Start with tablet Azithromycin 500 mg once daily for three consecutive days in a week for 4-6 weeks along with Nadifloxacin gel in the morning and Benzoyl peroxide 2.5 percent gel at night on the pimples. I hope it will help you. If a satisfactory response is not seen in six weeks we might need to add another capsule. You can revert back to me after six weeks for follow up. Also, keep your face dry, avoid applying oily creams and moisturizers, avoid oiling of the scalp, reduce the intake of sugary foods and try to reduce your weight.","{'score': 95, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 5, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hi doctor,
I am a 41-year-old male. For the past 30-40 days, I am facing issues with frequent urination. As soon as I drink water after 15-20 minutes, I get the urge to urinate, and the urine is white color or light yellow. Then I consulted the local physician, he gave Ofloxacin 200 for three to four days, but still I am having this issue. I did a urine test and it was negative. Then for some days, I thought it was due to weather, as this happened to me the last year too. I cannot remember, but during the monsoon or wintertime, I tried to avoid the AC and was feeling better. But now again it has started and not sitting in AC is not helping this time. Kindly advise because of anxiety, and stress I am now irritated with this issue.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Frequency of urination is related to a few causes small bladder incomplete emptying of bladder, increased amount of urine production, inflammation of bladder, inflammation of the prostate or inflammation of the urethra. Small bladder is unlikely as it is related to chronic inflammation or radiation and it is not the cause in your case. Incomplete emptying is related mainly due to enlarged prostate but this happens after usually the age of 50 years and it is persistent not recurrent so also unlikely. Bladder stone is also either secondary to obstruction or upper tract stone dropped in bladder which is also unlikely in your situation. Increase urine production is related to diabetes or medications or even increase fluid intake or increase drinking of coffee, tea, beer on empty stomach and increase of high potassium foods like bananas or even increase spices in food. Inflammation of bladder or urethra is associated with leukocytes in urine which is negative in your report. Inflammation of prostate is possible as sometimes urine is clear. Tests need to be done is urine for culture immediately after ejaculation and fasting blood sugar and ultrasound KUB kidney, ureter and bladder. Treatment starts from behavioral changes like drinking three liters of water daily. Reducing tea, coffee and spicy food. Reduction of high potassium containing food. Follow up with tests results.
Please record the timing and amount of urine you pass in 24 hours before follow up.","{'score': 88, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 7, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 80, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 7, 'transparency': 9}"

1. Yes, you can switch over to direct breastfeeding.
2. Make sure the baby latches the mouth to the breast properly.
3. Hold the baby and be seated in a comfortable position.
4. Initially, there will be discomfort for you and the baby. However, the baby might get frustrated as it requires coordinated efforts by both, so do not give up keep trying.
5. You can check on the internet on  how to breastfeed as there are various positions.
6. I am sure you will succeed in breastfeeding and it will be the best effort made by you for the baby.

"Hello doctor,I am 18 years old, 150 pounds, 5.8 foot male. I am in need of advice for my possible phimosis problem. I am uncircumcised and have never attempted to pull my foreskin back until yesterday. I was able to pull the foreskin back with some struggle but hardly any pain and got a look at the whole head. I have a few questions regarding this. When my foreskin is pulled back, at the end of the glans has excessive skin or somewhat around it and was worried if that was paraphimosis? No pain except when touching it and feels very sensitive including the glans. Is it okay to leave my foreskin back as it is able to stay retracted and will just have to wait for the sensitivity to desensitize? Now that I am able to pull my foreskin back when flaccid, I cannot pull it back when erect. So, could I retract the foreskin when flaccid and get erect as it is already retracted?","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have gone through your query, I would like to know a few more details to answer your query better. Have you ever had swelling of your foreskin? Has your foreskin never been retractable, even in childhood or is it a recent event? Was there any bleeding when you retracted it now? It appears that you have a tight foreskin and not phimosis, I would have to examine you to confirm the diagnosis. In either case, the treatment advised would be circumcision to avoid a possibility of paraphimosis at a later date. I would advise you to not keep your foreskin retracted as it may cause a paraphimosis, which will require surgery to correct it if left for long.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I fully understand your concern and will surely help you.
The MMR vaccine is a live vaccine and is not suitable for use during pregnancy. Further, you must be already aware that a month gap is recommended post-taking the MMR vaccine and planning conception. A few years back, it was a three-month gap recommendation. Being a live vaccine, there is a chance of rubella syndrome and heart defects post-MMR vaccine dose. Please visit your gynecologist as the case would require handling as per the national policy or laws regarding whether to abort or not.

I think your partner is rushing too much when having sex. You should collaborate with him, and give time to get a full orgasm along with your partner. If you do so, your vagina will get loose too.   However, if persisting, there are two main reasons

"Hello doctor,
I am going to be really specific so that you can best help me. Six months back, I went to the doctor, and I was prescribed Ciprofloxacin HCl Hydrochloride for a UTI Urinary Tract Infection. I took the antibiotic for 7 days. I am taking an oral contraceptive, and I am sexually active. During the week I was taking the antibiotic, I had unprotected sex once. The following week, I started my period as usual. I started a new pack of my birth control pills on after my periods. I forgot to take the pill on the eight-day, so I took two on the next day. I have not missed a pill or taken it late since then. There has been an increase in vaginal discharge for about 3 days. At first, there was no color to it, but yesterday, I noticed that there was a pink tint to it, and it is still present today. Everything that I have looked at online says it could be a sign of early pregnancy. What is your opinion?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
In my opinion, if you have had your period this month on time, and you have been on oral contraceptive birth control pills, then you are not pregnant at all. Sometimes, spotting continues longer with discharge in the initial days of the cycle because, during the previous proliferative phase, there can be left over endometrium, which is shed after that when you have your period. By proliferative I am referring to growth. During the second part of your menstrual cycle, hormones which your body produce naturally cause growth to occur in the lining of the uterus also called the endometrium. Oral contraceptive pills usually cause a reduction in bleeding and some cases, may cause spotting. So, please do not worry it is not pregnancy. This spotting should stop. Continue the pills you are taking, as prescribed. One missed pill is not the cause, as you correctly took two the next day.","{'score': 96, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,My child underwent pyeloplasty surgery when he was two and a half months old as he had uteropelvic junction obstruction in one kidney. He had his stent removed. Routine urine microscopy was performed and showed no signs of infections. However, the child has contracted with UTI and is currently taking antibiotics. Is it common to have UTIs in children after pyeloplasty?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I read your query and can understand your concern.
As per the information, your child is about five to six months old. Post pyeloplasty, and after removing the stent, they usually follow the kidney function and do ultrasonography USG of the kidney to check for any backflow or narrowing of the junction again. Another thing, the chances of getting an infection after kidney or ureteric procedures are higher than usual but keep it mild any child can get UTI urinary tract infection. What is more important is to treat it properly. I am sure they must have done a urine culture and sensitivity test, and according to that, only they must have advice for the antibiotics.
After finishing the antibiotic, if required, you need to go for USG again and another test, MCUG micturating cystourethrogram, depending on the USG report. In summary, the chances of UTI increase after this procedure. Therefore, give proper antibiotic courses and go for regular follow-ups.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Vaginal discharge is quite common. But green vaginal discharge means that you have a vaginal infection. The most common causes of greenish vaginal discharge are
1 yeast infection or vaginosis.
2 Sexually transmitted infections STI like trichomoniasis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia.
As you are not sexually active, STIs are uncommon. Cauliflower-like growth near the vaginal canal is mostly due to genital warts because of HPV. It could be non-sexually or sexually transmitted. Not all warts are cancerous, but we need a complete evaluation to see what kind of warts you are developing. Also, a per speculum examination of the cervix is required, as these growths are sometimes present in the cervical area too. You need to do certain investigations to know what organisms are causing the discharge and infection. Visit a local doctor for a per-speculum examination in detail. Take one probiotic tablet every day to strengthen your immune system and get rid of the symptoms. Do not finger or touch the vagina and avoid douching.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 93, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 9, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hi doctor,
I am a 20-year-old male suffering from a kind of health anxiety. Before the pandemic, I was anxious about my health. I had a change in my bowel habits and because of this, I started to pinch and touch my abdominal wall constantly. I palpated some veins under my skin and started examining them. It became a terrible habit in me and it lasted for seven months. I would pinch and pick the veins on my stomach from left to right again and again. I did it due to increased stress and anxiety during the pandemic. Now, my skin had never become red in the area where I pinch. I usually have slight irritation on this area after touching it with bare hands.
I do not have any scars or blood or wounds over it. I do only picking and I do not remember whether the veins were soft before I picking them. I feel harder but not painful. I have slight discomfort and I think that this has happened due to the movements of those veins from their original site. Probably, pinching has caused them to become superficial or made irritated. This discomfort resulted from lifting my arms and due to constant touching and massaging the area. I would like to know whether this behavior is considered self-harm. Is this a form of body-focused repetitive behavior? Please suggest.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
The veins in the abdomen cannot be palpated unless there is a severe liver disease or a block in the major vein that brings blood back to the heart. So it has to be ruled that there are engorged veins in the absence of any disease. The next concern is about your repeated behavior. Yes, it can happen especially when the person is under stress or anxiety. Some people resort to plucking hairs, some rotate their fingers and some start tapping their legs. All these happen without the realization of these persons. Sometimes, they become aware of it and also feels to stop it but still, it resists. In your case, it is anxiety that causes repetitive actions. It may not be harmful but it can cause embarrassment. I am not able to comment on the scars present on the abdomen or redness before examining it. Kindly consult the doctor and anxiety is a treatable condition.

"Hello,
I recently got four separators in my teeth for braces. I removed two of them myself after four days because they had a very foul smell, which gave me bad breath. Kindly help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Separators are placed to gain space for the placement of the molar band. Since you are going to start with orthodontic treatment, kindly maintain oral hygiene properly and gargle after every meal. The foul smell could have been due to food lodgement. Regarding the removal of separators, by this time it should have given enough space required. You can consult your dentist and get it checked. If there is not enough space required, separators will be placed for a few more days. Kindly maintain oral hygiene properly and follow the doctors instructions to get desired results. I hope I have cleared your doubts.

"Hi doctor,
I am just feeling panicky and anxious. But I have vaginal discharge that is similar to snot. It is thick, like whitish to pale yellow, like jiggly. I do not think it smells weird, but I feel anxious and uncomfortable, like an itch when my pants or shorts are tight around the crotch area. Also, I tried to insert a finger to feel if there was anything weird, but when I reached the farthest part, like the end part, it felt a bit weird and different, like it was very sensitive. I felt it under my navel. I got my period which is bright red and dark blood, filled maximum pad, and had normal premenstrual syndrome or cramps last month, but the last time I had intercourse, the condom almost slipped a third of the way while pulling out, but I can guarantee that it did not touch my vagina. I am very worried. Please help.
Thank you.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Please send me your detailed gynecology obstructive medical surgical drug history. It seems to be some pelvic infection or sexually transmitted disease and some local lesion.
It is better to take one local hysteroscopic examination, a collection of high vaginal swabs, any skin scrapping, or a swab from a lesion is better.
I suggest you have oral combined contraceptive pills for three months to regulate cycles.
Collect laboratory reports and discuss them here.
After collecting swabs, I suggest you have a tablet of Doxycycline 100 mg twice daily and a tablet of Metronidazole 400 mg 8 hourly for ten days and have a tablet of Clotrimazole at bedtime on three alternate nights to flow out candidiasis. Consult a specialist doctor, discuss with them, and take medication with their consent.
Have soft, comfortable cotton undergarments.
Use condoms to avoid sexually transmitted infections.
Have combined oral contraceptive pills for three months.
On the period day two, have a test for testosterone, progesterone, prolactin, insulin follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and thyroid function test.
Strict hygiene.
Have a healthy diet with less salt, sugar, and oil.
Have exercise and try to have a normal body mass index.
Please follow up for further assistance.

Your symptoms could be related to a damaged nerve. But, the good thing is that you are going to recover spontaneously. I recommend taking vitamin B complex supplements and Alpha-Lipoic acid 600 mg twice daily to help improve your situation faster.

"Hello doctor,
I had unprotected sex on the day of ovulation without knowing about it. I took a pill the very next day. How long may that be effective?
Kindly help.","Hello,
I am glad you chose icliniq for your medical-related queries.
I understand your concern. The emergency pill is a high dose of the progesterone hormone, the same hormone produced in your body during the second half of your menstrual cycle after ovulation. This pill will rapidly increase the thickness of the inner lining of the uterus, making it unfavorable for a possible pregnancy to implant. As it is a single dose, it lacks the strength to sustain itself, so it falls off, and you experience either periods or bleeding of the increased thickness within seven to ten days of taking the pill. This bleeding will consist of thick, fleshy pieces that are dark red or brown, accompanied by slight lower abdominal pain until the bleeding significantly decreases.
It is most effective within 24 hours, and it is not advisable to take it again during the same menstrual cycle. Taking it again can decrease its effectiveness and disrupt your hormonal balance and menstrual cycle. Therefore, it is recommended not to attempt it again, as it may cause confusion if your periods do not occur. If you are planning on having regular sex, the use of combined oral pills a packet of 21 pills is advisable. If sex is not going to be regular, using condoms is a better option.
Hope I have clarified your query. I will be happy to help you further.

"Hello doctor,
I am 27 years old. I got married three and a half years ago. I was diagnosed with PCOD four years ago. I had a laparoscopy a year ago. My reports are normal. My husbands sperm count is average. My menstrual cycles are regular. I began therapy about five months ago. My doctor recommended IUD therapy. One cycle of IUDs failed. Two processes of tiny cysts on my ovaries have resulted in the cancellation of the second round of IUD  and the usage of Novelon pills for the next 23 days. There are no more cysts on my ovaries. I am in my third month of IUD therapy, and this is my second cycle. This cycle, too, has failed. The following month, the fourth month, I discovered a little cyst and used the Novelon pill for 25 days with no further cysts on my ovaries. The following month, the fifth, I took Letroze 10 mg for five days beginning on the second day of my period. Until the ninth day, the effect of Novelon bleeding is less than typical, such as spotting. I have to go to the hospital. My ovary has just one follicle, and the follicle size is 20. Hence, this cycle IUD is canceled. The doctor gave me an HCG injection on the seventh day and told me to meet today and tomorrow. My issue is that I am getting minimal bleeding till the 9th, which is ovulation day. Pregnancy is not likely this month is it? Kindly help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I read your query and can understand your concern.
I see your management with hormones is not being done correctly. Here are a few facts about polycystic ovarian disease PCOD. This is a congenital disorder. It is a genetically determined disorder. It comes from your parents. When you gain weight suddenly, this cholesterol is converted into estrogen hormone, which is seen in obese men developing breasts and young obese girls developing periods at a younger age. It is due to high levels of estrogen hormone. When your body stores more fat than usual, which is a store for tomorrow, this extra fat is turned into the hormone that tips the scales between ovarian and follicle-stimulating hormones which comes from the brain. FSH Follicle-stimulating hormone promotes ovarian follicles however, once the follicle is large enough to ovulate, the FSH is repressed by the same estrogen hormone from the ovary. When the same estrogen hormone is produced by fat, the brain becomes confused, and follicle growth stops early at a reduced follicle size and does not burst the following scan will reveal all of these follicles. Obesity, irregular cycles, no periods for a few months, heavy periods with clots and fleshy lumps, or spotting on and off. Thyroid abnormalities and prolactin problems are all related to this.
You gain that extra layer of fat around your midsection, particularly around your waist, thighs, and breasts, with no fat beyond your elbows and knees. Also, excessive body hair development, hair loss, a dark shade over the bottom half of the face, acne, greasy facial skin, and black skin over the back of the neck, inner thighs, and under the breast may develop. Diabetes may run in the family, mainly via the father or his relatives. This will prevent ovulation and from becoming pregnant until you are cured. It also raises your chances of having an abortion during your first trimester. I stated your hormones have not been regulated because, as you can see, your follicles are not expanding, which means your egg cannot come out. As a result, administering the hormone on the seventh day is pointless. You cannot become pregnant with an unripe egg. The best thing to do is follicular stimulation, which will almost certainly result in many ripe follicles, followed by hormone injection and artificial insemination. You will undoubtedly become pregnant. Your artificial insemination was not performed correctly. Hence, you failed it was not your fault. Have trust that you will come out on top.
I hope I have answered your question.
Let me know if I can assist you further.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern. As a teenager, you have been experiencing menstrual periods with symptoms. Abdominal pains should be felt around your ovulation or menses. I think you can go for physiotherapy for pain relief. You should go for a transvaginal scan and discuss it with your local gynecologist doctor. My advise
Consult your specialist doctor, talk to them, and take medications with their consent.
Take a tablet of Ponstan Mefenamic acid 500 mg or tablet of Paracetamol 500 mg every eight hours for two to five days when you are in pain.
Take a tablet of Cyclizine Cyclizine Hydrochloride 50 mg nearly 45 minutes before food for vomiting.
Try to take a properly nutitious diet for good physical health, exercise, and other recreational activities.
Drink lots of water. Sometimes even citrus juices may also reduce the symptoms of mentrual cramps.
If no benefits are seen after using Paracetamol, you can consult your gynecologist doctor and ask for cyclic combined oral contraceptives pills for three cycles to relieve you hormonally.

"Hello doctor,I got a second-degree burn on my hand. It has been three weeks and is already in the pink skin stage, which is good. However, some places still have red raised areas on the skin. Will it leave a scar?Please suggest.Thank you.","Hello,Welcome to icliniq.com.I am very sorry to hear about your medical condition. Do not worry I am here to take care of you. The development of red raised skin in the area of a healing burn can be a normal part of the healing process. This is often due to the formation of new blood vessels and collagen as the skin repairs itself. Whether or not a scar will form depends on various factors, including the severity of the burn, the depth of tissue damage, and individual healing characteristics. Second-degree burns have the potential to leave scars, but the extent and appearance of the scar can vary. To minimize the risk of scarring and promote optimal healing, here are a few suggestionsKeep the area clean Gently cleanse the burn with mild soap and water to prevent infection. Avoid scrubbing the area, as it may delay healing and increase the risk of scarring.Apply a topical ointment Use an over-the-counter antibiotic ointment or a burn-specific ointment recommended by a healthcare professional to keep the area moisturized and protected. This can help promote healing and reduce the risk of infection.Protect the area Cover the burn with a sterile non-stick dressing or a clean cloth to protect it from further injury, dirt, and sun exposure.Avoid picking or scratching Refrain from picking at any scabs or peeling skin, as this can increase the risk of scarring.Follow the healthcare professionals advice If you have not already done so, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional, such as a doctor or dermatologist, who can assess the burn and provide specific guidance on wound care and scar prevention.It is worth noting that scars can take time to fade and may be more noticeable initially.Thank you for using icliniq, and have a nice day.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

So it is not advisable to have any medication for pregnancy in the same cycle as the removal. As blood is not a good medium for sperm, sperm motility is reduced or stopped by blood components. You can try for pregnancy, but when there is blood with a raw area in the cervical canal, sperm health may be reduced. You can have sexual contact after the bleeding stops, usually which stops within 2 to 3 days. Next period your chances will be better.

Welcome to icliniq.com. I had gone through all the data you have posted. Some things are important in what you said. First diagnosis of hypertension HTN at 22 years of age has to be seriously looked into unless there is strong family history for the same. For the diagnosis of HTN three office recordings at different hospital visits, each visit mean value of three recordings if more than 14090 mmHg and patient should not drink tea or smoke within 5 minutes of blood pressure measurement. If your diagnosis of HTN was true, then further investigation is necessary to rule out secondary causes of hypertension. Hypertension and weakness of legs may be because of hypokalemia low potassium level. Kindly do serum potassium levels. Kindly start with lifestyle changes like low salt in diet, avoid pickles, stop alcohol or smoking if you have habit of and do regular physical activity. Regarding weakness of legs, we need more description where exactly the problem is. Weakness has to be muscular or neurological in nature. If neurologic then symptoms will be like dragging pain lower back to foot, slippage of slippers while walking, feeling unstable while walking. If weakness is muscular then you may have difficulty in getting up from squatting position and cramps like pain. Please feel relaxed and this is not the age for any major problems to exist. We think of all the possibilities just to be sure we should not miss anything major. Do meditation or yoga to decrease tension. You need to do lipid profile, serum potassium and get back to me with reports and mention more regarding the problems if any.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 89, 'clinical_accuracy': 17, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 7, 'transparency': 9}"

Welcome back to icliniq.com.
Thank you for your query. It is not a cardiac cause of pain, neither your age nor any of your investigation points towards it. Now, exactly pinpointing the diagnosis, I will need some more information, like site pain, any increase in pain after food or on deep breathing, do you smoke, whether is there any increase in pain on applying pressure, etc. First, the possibility in general is gastritis and reflux disease. This kind of chest pain is associated with upper abdominal pain, nausea, bloating, burping, an increase in pain after food, and a sour water taste in the throat, if this is present then it supports the diagnosis, then avoid fatty, oily, and high-calorie diet. Have some walks after having food instead of taking a rest. Have multiple small meals instead of heavy meals. Have regular sleep habits and avoid stress. Have lots of green leafy vegetables, fruits. Avoid smoking and alcohol if any. You can take a tablet of Pantoprazole 40 mg before breakfast once a day for 2 weeks. Another possibility is musculoskeletal pain, this pain will increase of application of pressure on the chest. Next is pain from the lung lining and this pain increases with deep breathing.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I went through your query as well as the investigations attachment removed to protect patient identity.
From your reports, you seem to be suffering from irritable bowel syndrome IBS.
The condition responds to Rifaximin Rifagut for a short term. The long term treatment is based on the identification of the diet that results in initiating of symptoms. You need to maintain a food record to see on what day you had severe symptoms and identify what you had taken on that day.
Meanwhile, if you have symptoms of bloating, I would suggest you take
Capsule Sompraz L Esomeprazole and Levosulpiride at bedtime.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Did you take any medications like antibiotics or painkillers to treat COVID-19 infection coronavirus disease 2019? How severe is the pain in your stomach?

I am a male, 23 years old, weight is 65 kg, height is 59. My penis is not getting hard for sex. The penis is getting erect but not getting hard enough.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have read your problems carefully. After getting above mentioned history, my assumption is that your problem is psychological rather than organic. But I need some information and investigation reports to confirm it further. If you want to visit any physician, I advise to consult with endocrinologist first and after excluding organic disease, you need a psychiatrist.
Masturbation and doing sex are different issues. In the case of masturbation, we try to ejaculate as soon as possible. But in case of doing sex, we try to do sex as long as possible. So there is a psychological issue. Besides this, anxiety also can precipitate this problem. So after doing some investigation and excluding organic cause, I think you need some psychological counseling.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 93, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}"
"Hi doctor,
My girlfriend has an irregular menstrual cycle. Before two months, we cuddled a week after her menstrual flow. I did not penetrate her since she is still a virgin, and I am sure I did not ejaculate in her. But she missed her period last month until now. What could be the reason?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have read your concern. I can surely tell you that she is not pregnant if your facts are correct. There can be innumerable causes of missed periods and abnormal periods. The best way to evaluate is to get thyroid profile and serum prolactin levels empty stomach. This will give us a very good idea of the ongoing issues such as hypothyroidism and hyperprolactinemia are very common causes of these symptoms. Next in the line will be FSH follicle-stimulating hormone and LH luteinizing hormone levels, but thats a latter issue. 90  of patients get diagnosed with the initial two tests.
You can follow up with further reports. Treatment for the same will be started after the reports. But nothing to worry about. It is curable.

"Hello doctor,Yesterday, my condom broke as I was entering the vagina of an unknown lady. The whole episode happened so fast less than five to 10 seconds. I am not sure if the tip of my circumcised penis was in contact with the inside of the vagina or the butt hole, as I could not see. The lady said the condom rubbed off against her dry vagina, and it caused the condom to break, and that she does not think I penetrated her. We were only going to start sex when this happened. I also did not feel like my penis was entirely inside her, but I was only trying to get my penis in when this happened. But then I inserted my penis shortly because of this incident, and it started to worry me. I was afraid that my penis may have made contact with the entrance of her vagina. The lady did mention that she tests herself regularly and is clean and that if I did penetrate her, she would be more worried than me. Despite the assurances, I am still worried. From the above information, do you think that I engaged in any unprotected penetrative sex? Should I be worried about HIV or other STIs? Please help.Thank you.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I can understand your concern.
The chances of transmission of HIV human immunodeficiency virus through single unprotected intercourse are low. The act can be considered almost as unprotected intercourse as there was a condom tear. If the person is HIV-negative, then there is no chance of transmission of HIV.
You can consult your doctor for further risk assessment and the need for PEP post-exposure prophylaxis. If needed, PEP must be initiated as early as possible and not later than 72 hours of exposure. Some STDs sexually transmitted diseases like herpes simplex virus can be transmitted by skin-to-skin contact or through kissing. Please go for baseline STD panel tests now and after 90 days of exposure to be relieved of anxiety totally and to obtain conclusive results.
I wish you good health.

It started off as a single bump, but with time, I started getting two at once, and now I just had to deal with a few of them. They are itchy and unpleasant, and I am tired of them. I think it is hair folliculitis, but I am not sure. What can I do to prevent this? I went to see a gynecologist, but the ointment she prescribed Canex V did not show any effect.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your worry. I request you to share a picture of the afflicted region as well as a medical history, if there was unprotected intercourse, one should consider sexually transmitted illnesses. So I recommend that you take the following tests
Tpha Treponema pallidum hemagglutination.
HPV DNA PCR polymerase chain reaction of the DNA  test.
Herpes simplex virus HSV one and two IgG.
Herpes simplex virus HSV one and two IgM, serum.
Chlamydia trachomatis IgG.
HIV one and two antibodies, screening test.
HBsAg.
Urine complete
Otherwise, it might be a simple bacterial infection. For 5 days, use T. coli antibiotic ointment locally and take a tablet Doxycycline 100 mg antibiotic twice a day. If there is irritation, consider a fungal infection ointment Candid B antifungal for topical treatment, and a pill for itching. Once a night, take Cetirizine antihistamine. Wash your private parts twice a day, in the morning and at night, using regular water, avoid cold or hot water. Avoid using high-pH soap.

Based on the description you mentioned, it appears that you have this condition called intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy ICP, which can cause elevated liver enzymes or bilirubin along with itching.  But however, it is important to rule out other causes of elevated liver enzymes SGOT, SGPT, ALP like hepatitis, HELLP syndrome syndrome of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count. Each condition can have different implications in pregnancy. Please check for your blood pressure records, platelets count, coagulation profile, viral markers HBsAg, Anti HCV, HEV IgG and IgM. It would have been good if you could share the reports of your liver function tests and ultrasound abdomen for liver and also given details about any other symptoms you have faced like any stool or urine color changes, skin or eyes color changes, any fever, any raised blood pressure records, or any skin rashes excluding that caused due to scratching because of itching.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
You have severe constipation, for which we need to clear the impaction. If you are passing gas and there is no distention of abdomen, then we can give a dose of laxatives, although you may require more doses.
I suggest you get an x-ray abdomen and share the report. I suggest you try doing the following.
Try taking Peglec powder combination of Sodium bicarbonate, Sodium and Potassium chloride, Sodium sulfate, and Peg-electrolytes, one packet in two 2 liters of water, after this you will pass loose stools. If the stool is not like water, then you can take one more dose.
Once it gets cleared, then try taking a maintenance dose of laxatives. I suggest Laxopeg Polyethylene Glycol, two sachets, once a day at night.
Take a high-fiber diet. Drink plenty of water. Avoid junk foods. You will need to take laxatives for a long time.
Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. Review back as per your requirement.

"Hello doctor,For the past week, I have been consistently consuming alcohol, and as a result, I am experiencing severe chest pain, specifically on the right side beneath the breastbone. The pain has become unbearable. I am unable to eat anything, and even swallowing water is causing excruciating pain in the affected area. Despite taking Pan-D Pantoprazole, Simethicone, and Magaldrate, my condition has not improved. Kindly help.Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Thank you for your query. I read your query and understood your concern.
The symptoms you described, including severe chest pain and difficulty swallowing, could potentially be related to a condition called gastritis or even gastroesophageal reflux disease GERD. These conditions can be exacerbated by alcohol consumption.
Gastritis is inflammation of the lining of the stomach, which can cause pain, discomfort, and difficulty eating. GERD, on the other hand, occurs when stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, leading to symptoms such as heartburn, chest pain, and difficulty swallowing.
While over-the-counter medications like antacids can provide temporary relief for mild cases of gastritis or GERD, persistent or worsening symptoms may require medical attention. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
In the meantime, you can try some self-care measures to alleviate your symptoms
Avoid alcohol, spicy foods, acidic foods, and caffeine, as they can worsen symptoms.
Eat smaller, more frequent meals and chew your food thoroughly.
Avoid lying down or going to bed immediately after meals.
Raise the head of your bed or use extra pillows to elevate your upper body while sleeping.
Consider trying over-the-counter medications such as proton pump inhibitors PPIs or H2 blockers, but only under the guidance of a healthcare professional.
Take the tablet Pantocid DSR once a day for seven days.
Take syrup Sucrafil  O 15 ml three times a day for seven days.
However, it is crucial to seek medical advice promptly to get a proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment for your specific situation. A healthcare professional will be able to evaluate your symptoms, perform any necessary tests, and provide you with the most suitable treatment plan.
I hope my advice will be helpful. Feel free to reach out if you have any further queries.

Also, bloating is very uncomfortable. Should I again consult a urologist? I feel there are gastric problems and there is also a pain in the groin during bowel movements. I am currently on Alfoo. Please help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Your symptoms of groin pain while sitting or during bowel movements is likely due to an inguinal hernia.
The pancreatic irritation is unlikely to cause such a pain. It causes periumbilical pain and also there is no cause for it.
Now, next is there a hernia or not is unsure. If it is present then you need to visit a general surgeon, confirm it and get operated as it can cause complications.
In patients with hernia, they have groin swelling, sometimes only seen on standing and coughing. Just check if it is present for you or not.
For your bloating problem, you should avoid fatty, oily and spicy diet.
You need to have some walk after having food instead of taking rest.
You need to have regular sleep habits and avoid stress.
Have lots of green leafy vegetables, fruits and avoid smoking and alcohol if any.
Try to achieve some weight loss through diet and regular exercise.
I suggest you take tablet Pantodac DSR Domperidone and Pantoprazole 40 mg before breakfast once a day for two weeks.
Also, you should get dewormed yourself with tablet Bandy-Plus Albendazole and Ivermectin at bedtime once and another dose should be repeated after two weeks. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and with their consent take the above medicines.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Thanks for the briefing regarding the problem in concern. I had a detailed look at the picture you have sent attachments removed to protect the patients identity. The tympanic membrane eardrum perforations may close spontaneously under certain specific conditions. Smaller the size of the hole, the higher the chance of closure. The wet and actively discharging ear will not close spontaneously. An intact mastoid system and eustachian tube ventilation have a higher chance of closure. If you have small perforation, and if it is dry without any discharge and underlying comorbidities, and also, if your ear does not get infected in between, there is a possibility that your eardrum will close spontaneously. We can wait for eight to ten weeks for the perforation to close on its own. I hope this answers your query.

"Hello doctor,
I recently traveled abroad and it was around 20 hours of flying both ways. I returned two days ago and went to the doctor with some pain in my knee. He ordered an ultrasound which came back negative for blood clots. Yesterday, I worked myself into a panic attack and returned to the doctor who then did a D-dimer. My results came below 0.5, specifically at 0.41. However, I had a D-dimer last year that was 0.33, so it is elevated based on that baseline. The doctor who delivered both results said to come back if the pain did not subside or got worse. As of today, the pain is not worse but does feel like it has spread into the top of my calf and back of my thigh. It feels kind of like a minor cramp. My question is whether it is possible that these tests were conducted too early, potentially leading to a misdiagnosis of DVT. And could my increased D-dimer levels be a result of the early stages of a blot clot? And if so, would you recommend I go to the ER tonight or wait until the doctor opens in the morning?
Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I can understand your concern. The probable cause for the pain you are experiencing can be a long journey by flight. Since you are still having some pain and discomfort in the legs and the posterior aspect of the thighs, I would suggest you consult a general surgeon. Other than the said blood tests, I would also suggest you get a venous Doppler test done to see for DVT deep vein thrombosis. Along with this, an arterial Doppler can also be carried out. Please do not exert your lower limbs, till the surgeon rules out any DVT. Also, it would be good to keep both your legs in an elevated position to prevent edema formation.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have seen the image attachment removed to protect patient identity. This looks just like hemorrhoid typically that occurs with constipation and goes away on its own. The solution is to avoid constipation by drinking more than enough water and taking fiber-rich foods like raw leafy vegetables and green fruits. Also, avoid meats and non-vegetarian items currently as they aggravate this issue. You may continue the laxative that you are taking as well till your constipation is better but not more than two weeks. Take care and get well soon.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,
I am a 61-year-old with breast cancer metastasizing to the liver, nodes, and bones. I am currently on Abraxane and Herceptin. I was diagnosed 19 years back and had 15 years of no cancer. Metastasis to a few nodes was noted four years back. I have been on Taxol, Taxatore and now Abraxane. I morphed into triple positive a year ago. I know my chance of getting brain metastasis is high. A few days back at work I noticed the left side of my chin was numb. I looked it up and read horrible information that it is from the mandible or cerebellum. And the outlook was ominous. I am so frightened. My question is how serious is numbness in this condition? I can feel pain when I pinch and poke at my chin. It does not feel like when I get Novacane at the dentist. I do get Xgeva every three months, have bad sinus and vertigo problems just recently and am depressed and have horrible anxiety which I try to control with Xanax. I will see my oncologist in a few days for treatment. I just need some reassurance, I guess. I have no pain from any of my metastasis. Just side effects from chemotherapy. I had laboratory tests done weeks ago. I am anemic due to chemotherapy. My liver panel is normal. I am currently taking Lotrel and Zoloft.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
You have been living with this cancer for a long time and have a lot of information about it. This numbness on your chin can be a side effect of your chemotherapy but without MRI magnetic resonance imaging of the brain very difficult to say you do not have any brain metastasis. But be assured cerebellar metastasis usually have the problem of maintaining of balance rather than just sensory disturbance. You are getting best treatment trust in your creator and be bold. If you have done any radiology to rule out any brain metastasis. And if done and is negative then relax and pray and hope for a long life. I wish you a long productive life and I hope I answered your questions.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"

Your concern may be oral lichen planus which is an autoimmune issue which is treatable. Or this can be aphthous stomatitis which are oral ulcers and they are also treatable.

Lingual tonsils may get enlarged during an episode of upper respiratory tract infection.

That is causing the granular pharyngitis, tonsillitis and mucus drip down the throat. I suggest you take the following medications. Tablet of Trypsin-Chymotrypsin combination that acts as anti-inflammatory twice a day before meals, with Acetaminophen tablet as and when needed, with steam inhalation and Chlorhexidine mouth gargles. Continue this for five days. I also suggest you a tablet of Omeprazole once daily before breakfast for two weeks.

"Hi doctor,
I am a 50 year old male. I have been having intermittent episodes of moderate dizziness preceded by pain in the neck or head. It happens almost four times a year and some of these symptoms are also preceded with chest tightness and heart palpitations. On one of such occasion, I thought I would black out, so I went to the local hospital. Unfortunately, they made mistakes which led to the various electrocardiogram ECG readings and Holter monitor readings to go missing due to faulty equipment. I do not have any congenital heart issues, so I am wondering why am I experiencing some strange pinging sensations at times which cause no pain. I also visited a neurologist whom I believe did not take me seriously and a head magnetic resonance imaging MRI showed no issues. After a couple of years of this, I went to a clinical laboratory to have an allergy test done, concentrating on metals as I have titanium screw from a tooth implant. The tests showed no allergy reaction to metals, but it did show an antibody response to myelin basic protein, which could indicate an autoimmune problem affecting nerves. The first test showed below 2 which is the baseline between reactive and non-reactive indication and the second test sample was also 2, but the third test was 3, which is above the baseline. The report for this memory lymphocyte immunostimulation assay MELISA test explained that this could indicate that my immune system was attacking the myelin protein. I am concerned as I am at an early stage of an autoimmune disease. I am not sure what the next step should be. Also, several years ago I had an MRI on my back L5 area due to an old injury, and they noted a perineural cyst. It seems like my back injury to this area has improved with treatment but other symptoms as mentioned above have replaced them. Can you please provide some clue regarding the meaning of the MELISA test results and what my next step should be? I will shortly have a follow-up MRI done to identify any further degeneration of my spine, including the neck as well.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com. I read your query and understand your concerns. With available reports, I feel the memory lymphocyte immunostimulation assay MELISA test reports and your clinical symptoms have a very poor correlation, and it is possible that they are not related. As all the obtained test results are borderline, MELISA test memory lymphocyte immunostimulation assay has a high false-positive value. The myriad of symptoms you are experiencing have little correlation with autoimmune disorders, and that make me conclude that they are not related. However, I will suggest you undergo magnetic resonance imaging MRI at the time of your next episode, as that may reveal the true nature of the pathology. Despite the facts mentioned above, I am recommending it because it is possible that when you got tested there was remission in neurological pathology which leads to borderline symptoms.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 93, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 81, 'clinical_accuracy': 15, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 7, 'transparency': 8}"
"Hello doctor,
I am a 40-year-old female. I was diagnosed with celiac disease two years back. I was traveling, so I was not able to have a biopsy done at that time. Shortly after that, I became pregnant. My baby is now eight weeks old. Throughout my pregnancy, my tTg levels were monitored, but they never went back to normal despite my efforts to remain on a gluten-free diet. They were slowly going down, though, and measured around 27 Uml. At the time, I had some symptoms about once a week, I had loose stools for a day. Eventually, that went away. I had another blood test recently, and my doctor said that my tTg levels are higher than before. The doctor referred me to a gastroenterologist and instructed me to eat gluten. I am hesitant to do this because my 8-week-old baby is exclusively breastfed. However, I currently have no symptoms. I had a healthy pregnancy. I do not feel like I am depleted of nutrients. Would you recommend that I should start eating gluten again?
Kindly help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Thank you for your query.
I have reviewed your history and would like to see your tTg-IgA tissue transglutaminase levels. Celiac disease has a vast clinical spectrum, from loose stools, weight loss, and bloating to low blood levels. Even we have diagnosed patients with celiac who are clinically asymptomatic. So your symptoms cannot tell you whether you have celiac or not or whether you are nutritionally all good. As you are done with your pregnancy, I would like to go for an endoscopy and take duodenal biopsies to confirm celiac disease. If your tTg-IgA levels are high these days, your food is contaminated with gluten somehow, and if your tTg-IgA levels are standard these days. During endoscopy, you should be on a gluten diet for four to six weeks so that it causes changes in the duodenum which is expected to see while doing an endoscopy.
Kindly share all your reports.

"Hello doctor,
I have had premature ventricular contraction for six years, and I take tablet Metoprolol 50 mg once daily. My ventricular contractions are stacked and create a non-sustained ventricular tachycardia.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Thanks for the query and detailed symptom description. Many arrhythmias are accompanied by gastrointestinal symptoms. I have noticed this in my experience but the reason is unknown. Most probably it might be a trigger for PVC premature ventricular contractions, which leads to small upsets in our body equilibrium. I suggest you to investigate for gastrointestinal disorders and get an opinion from a gastroenterologist. For now take tablet Esomeprazole alone may not work for GERD gastro esophageal reflux disease and you would have to add Domperidone with this. Also you need to get that hiatus hernia investigated as these tend to lie in close proximity of the heart and could possibly provoke PVCs. Lastly for the PVCs itself you could increase the Metoprolol dosage to 50 mg twice a day or 100 mg twice a day, provided you can tolerate it, also non sustained V-tach ventricular tachycardia are not really seen with benign PVCs so it may be wise to image the heart with an MRI magnetic resonance imaging to rule out structural heart disease.

Your EKG shows sinus tachycardia and probably left ventricular hypertrophy attachment removed to protect patient identity.

If your heart rate is high at almost all the times then also have ambulatory EKG electrocardiogram done for 24 hours.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I read your query and understand your concern.
I do not think you have any reason to worry. At this early gestation of 14 weeks, the position of the placenta is not important at all. The baby grows faster than the placenta. Placental size is almost the same size. As the baby grows it will pull the placenta up and by 28 to 30 weeks it will be far away from your cervical os and you should have a normal delivery. A few good points to be noted are given in the following -
1. The placenta will be adherent in the lower segment if you had a scar from a previous cesarean or any surgery and the placenta was in the anterior wall, not the posterior as in your case.
2. Had the placenta been central, I mean completely over the os, then the chances of the placenta staying back in the lower segment would have been high. In your case I am almost sure it will go up.
I do scans in pregnancies and almost 50  to 60  of placentae are in the lower segment, they get corrected over time and most of them have a normal delivery. You can definitely travel by flight for 16 weeks.
Hope I have clarified your query. Do write back if you have any more queries.

"Hello doctor,
I am a 25-year-old lady about 6 to 7 weeks pregnant. My HbA1c is 12. What should I do?","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
According to diabetes guidelines, the patient should have strict diabetic control pre-pregnancy. It is better to have a strict diabetic diet and sugar levels within the normal range and have HbA1c less than 6. Frankly speaking, I feel that during conception, less than 6 or 5 would be better but at 10, it is advised not to conceive but I think after conception it would have increased. As with high sugar levels, more chances of congenital anomalies in the fetus are there, most popular is heart defects.
The baby could have diabetes and could grow fast due to sugar level imbalance and can be large for the gestational age. It can have stillbirth, difficult delivery, intrauterine death, etc. Please contact a consultant obstetrician and discuss your detailed history and treatment till now. In pregnancy, Insulin is preferred over oral medications. Have a strict diabetic diet, daily walk, yoga, or mild exercises. Try to have strict monitoring of fetus as well as your sugar levels. Things could be well only with strict diabetic treatment and precautions for the whole pregnancy.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 19, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 9, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

"Hi doctor,I am a 25-year-old. I have OCD. I have had the habit of counting books for the past five to six years. I have disturbed sleep with many thoughts for one hour for at least seven to eight years. But, for the last two years, I am avoiding such rational things. I also experience mood-changing behavior, sometimes I am very confident, and excited, and sometimes very depressed. I have started avoiding having such thoughts. It affected my sleeping pattern entirely. I wake up every day with the confusion that I have not slept for the entire night. I have experienced child bullying in my school days. My classmate used to beat me every time in those days. My father is dominating, and my mother has experienced domestic violence. My home environment was tense in my childhood days. In my school days, I had a better memory power to remember the page numbers. But now, I am having low memory power after I got OCD. I had no stage daring from early childhood. Now, I avoid public meetings, and family functions because I am afraid of talking with a large group of people. Sometimes, I am scared of talking to a specific individual. All these things have affected my life entirely. I have missed a lot of opportunities due to these problems. I have a family history of issues in mental health. I have taken medication Fluvoxamine, SSRI, Olenz, and Clonazepamine last year. But I felt tired and sleepy every day after taking pills for two to three months. So I stopped it. Now what to do, received treatment from four to five doctors. But I have not visited consistently due to sleepiness, and tiredness due to medication. Still, the problem persists. Now, what to do?","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I can understand your concern. You are having symptoms of OCD obsessive-compulsive disorder, social anxiety, and depression. You have controlled most of your OCD symptoms and have a problem with excessive sedation with the drug. Most SSRIs selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, Oleanz Olanzapine, and Clonazepam can cause sedation. But Fluoxetine is one of the SSRIs that usually does not cause sedation. If your doctor has not tried Fluoxetine, then you can ask him to give you a trial of it as it has good efficacy for OCD and depression. Also, psychotherapy has good positive evidence in the management of OCD. If you have not received it, go for it, it is a type of therapy in which the therapist will lead you to behave in a better way. Forgetfulness can be due to many reasons including poor attention, depression, and poor concentration. Do regular exercise and take adequate sleep. Avoid any substance use like alcohol, or smoking.

"Hello doctor,
I love my family. However, there is a huge ideological difference between my mother and me. Our religious views are poles apart and I feel someone is smothering me with those ideologies because I tend to take full control of situations under me. eg vegetarian vs non-vegetarian, etc.I cannot seem to express myself clearly. I feel like I should be leaving home and live my life the way I want to. But I always end at the same level and I tend to forget. I feel this has been an ongoing issue in my life. I am going through a divorce and I started having trust issues with people. Please help me and guide me.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Your dilemma is quite common. It is perfectly normal to have ideological differences with family members, but we can continue to be close to our family. You made a very important comment that I cannot seem to express myself clearly.  It is important to sit down with your mother and have an open talk about these issues which is grinding you down.
Sometimes parents do not always  realize their children are grown up adults and have a mind on their own. Being clear and explicit with your mother about topics to avoid will help to ease your tension. Is your mother trying to be supportive in her way? Going through a divorce can be a stressful experience for anyone. It can have an overall  exhausting effect on your life but will gradually get better with time.
I can understand your predicament. I think sometimes we have to accept that you cannot change an adults personality but work around minimizing conflict. In this situation, it will help to just accept your mother as she is and learn to tolerate some amount of disagreement. Gradually develop better-coping strategies. Yoga and meditation can help.
Look after yourself during this period. Eat healthily, sleep well, exercise regularly, talk to trusted family members and friends. Do not isolate yourself as it can worsen the situation. If you find it difficult to cope, you can consider professional counseling.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 80, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"

Chronic patient of the prostate. Size 47 by 41 by 38 mm, volume 39 cc. Pre-void urine 281 cc, post void residual 71 cc. Please explain.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
How old are you?
There is no need to worry. Small concretions are commonly found in the gallbladder. Also, the prostate size is enlarged and it is probably due to a benign prostatic hypertrophy. You should get Serum PSA prostate-specific antigen levels done, which would suggest the possible abnormalities in the prostate.
At this stage, to prevent gallstones formation, it is recommended that you try to maintain a healthy body weight by consuming appropriate calories and exercising for at least 30 minutes, five days a week.
Also, for the prostate problem, if you have any symptoms like straining at urination or an increased frequency of urine, then you should get medicines like tab Urimax D a combination of Tamsulosin and Dutasteride 0.4 mg prescribed to be taken at bedtime.
Hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Ongoing through your history, you can have PCOD polycystic ovaries. It is a congenital condition. It is genetical. You can get it from your parents. When you have a sudden gain in weight, the cholesterol is converted into estrogen hormone. When there is fat in the body more than average, it is converted to hormones. FSH follicle stimulating hormone stimulates follicle from the ovary. When the follicle is ready to ovulate, the FSH is suppressed by the estrogen hormone from the ovary. When the estrogen hormone comes from fat, the brain becomes confused, and the follicle growth stops at a smaller follicular size, and it will not rupture. On the next scan, you will see these follicles as polycystic ovaries.
It is usually associated with obesity, irregular menstrual cycles, absence of periods for a few months and later there can be a heavy period with clots and fleshy masses or spotting on off and off. There can be a thyroid abnormality and prolactin problem indirectly. You will develop an extra pad of fat around the mid-segment of the body, especially in waist, thighs, and breast. There will be an absence of fat below elbows and knees. There will be an excessive hair growth, hair fall, a dark shade over the lower half of the face, acne, oily face, black skin over the back of the neck, inner thighs and undersurface of the breast. You may have a family history of diabetes. Regular ovulation will not occur during this problem, and you cannot get pregnant until it is treated. It increases the chance of early pregnancy abortions.
There is a solution, when you have a reduction of weight to normal range, then there is no requirement of medicines to get periods or to get pregnant, and pregnancy will be healthy. Avoid eating junk foods, fast foods, and red meat. Reduce taking snacks in between meals. Have a low-calorie diet with high proteins. Do regular exercise especially for waist and hip area, aerobics, yoga, and brisk walking. Try to reduce 4 to 8 lbs per month. When there is a loss of weight of 11 lbs, you can see changes. You will not require medications and the problems during periods will resolve soon without medications. If you want to have regular periods till you reduce weight, you can have birth control pills cyclically from the first day of the periods for three to six cycles. It will regularize your hormones and periods.","{'score': 91, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"

The main purpose of the ear plug is to protect your hearing from getting damaged. They are perfectly inserted even though you cannot hear the sound. Additionally, every ear canal is of different shapes and size. Thus the fitting will be different. Of course, if you push the plugs far deeply, it may harm your ear drum.

Welcome to iciniq.com.
I read your query and understand your concern.
Based on the available details, there is no chance of getting pregnant. This is because
The fertile period for a woman is typically around 14 days before her menstruation. Your girlfriend had only two days left for her period, which means the likelihood of being in her fertile period is very low or negligible.
She had her period after the sexual activity, which further rules out pregnancy.
Even if there was actual intercourse with full ejaculation in the vagina, the conclusion would remain the same.

"Hello doctor,
I have had secondary infertility for two years. I have a child who was born six years ago by cesarean. I did not have issues conceiving her. We started trying for the second baby four years back. I conceived within a month of trying. It was an ectopic pregnancy in my right tube and was treated with a tablet Methotrexate. One year later, we met a fertility specialist who suggested a few tests. There were no apparent concerns except that TSH was slightly elevated, and the right fallopian tube was slightly dilated. Persistent fluid was observed in the ultrasound. Also, I do not have a history of STDs. I was prescribed the tablet Clomid three years back.
Fourteen days DPO, I found out I was pregnant, but my hCG levels were extremely low. They did not rise appropriately, and the pregnancy was diagnosed as PUL suspected ectopic, and was treated with tablet Methotrexate. We tried IVF the same year. My doctor said a cesarean scar defect required surgery, during which they removed my right tube. My left appeared normal and was confirmed open previous HSG test. We planned for FET frozen embryo transfer the next year and transferred a 6AA PGS normal blast. A small amount of fluid was persistent that got cleared with progesterone administration. HCG levels were only 8.9 mIUmL. Two days later, they were 12 mIUmL. I was advised to stop medications and my periods started, but then the levels rose appropriately, so I went back on medications. Pregnancy did not occur, even though the levels rose but started decreasing on their own. The diagnosis was PUL but suspected ectopic. I have three embryos left and will be doing another transfer. But I feel like there is something wrong that they are missing. Being a fully hatched embryo, it had to be implanted before having time to float to my tube. I am worried about endometrial receptivity. However, my doctor is not recommending ERA. But he is unsure as to why this keeps happening.
Kindly advise.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern.
Many factors are involved in the natural conception process, which sometimes go wrong if the treatment goes wrong. I suggest you to go for complete treatment for any of your health issues. It would help if you had a balanced diet, weight, and BMI body mass index. The hormonal imbalance needs to be sorted out by a fertility specialist. Also, blood pressure and sugar levels must be within normal levels. It would help if you get your folic acid levels checked regularly. If there is any pelvic pain or fluid inside the tubes, it must be checked for infection and must be treated for conception. I suggest you to discuss all the details with the treating doctor.

"Hello doctor,
I think my skin is getting tanned since my hands, legs, and forehead become black. Am I losing my original color? Also, I have hair fall problems. I travel on a bike and I wear a helmet, will that be a reason for hair fall? Please help.
Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I read your query and understand your concern.
Tanning is usually found on sun-exposed parts as you have already mentioned like the face, hands, and sometimes legs. You should use some good sunscreen with an SPF of more than 30 to be applied every morning around 9 am, 12 pm, and 3 pm, that is, it has to be repeated every two to three hours. Along with you can use some depigmenting creams containing Kojic acid available with various names like Clearz cream at night time on the tanned part.
Hair fall can be because of many reasons like nutritional deficiency, dandruff, stress, medical illness, thyroid disorders, hormonal, and many more.

"Hello doctor,
My friend has a brain aneurysm and lung cancer. He is undergoing treatments for both. Now, the medicine for lung cancer is hampering the aneurysm. What to do? Please suggest.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com. Brain aneurysm can be a different entity or due to the metastasis of lung cancer to the brain. It is a very difficult condition to treat as both diseases have a very grave prognosis. Usually, the treatment of aneurysm is by clipping or coiling, but certain medicines are also given to make the blood thin. There are many drugs that interact with the drugs used for lung cancer. In fact, chemotherapy for the lung cancer has very toxic side effects on all body parts. So, this situation has to be handled by the specialist doctors. The most important issue to be noted while treatment is that the general condition must be stable in order to start chemotherapy for the lung cancer. It is very difficult to comment on the specific medicine hampering the treatment with the little information provided by you.","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 7, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,
I ejaculated in my pants when my girlfriend was straddling me and sitting on my crotch area. As soon as I did, she got off. I had boxers and pants on, and there was a little stain from the semen on my pants. There was no penetration. Should I be concerned about potential pregnancies?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I can understand your concern. I have read your query, and there is no chance of pregnancy in your case because sperm can not travel and survive on clothes. Semen in its liquid form travels through clothes, but it also dries out when it comes in contact with air. Sperm cannot swim through clothes, reach the vagina, and make someone pregnant. It is very difficult to identify sperm in semen. So there is no chance of pregnancy in your case. I hope you found it helpful.

"Hello doctor,
I am a 50-year-old female who would like to have a breast reduction. However, I am at high risk for vomiting from the anesthesia as I have a phobia of vomiting, and I am susceptible to motion sickness. I am a non-smoker. I had general anesthesia once before, and I vomited several times. I am so scared that I have rescheduled the surgery three times. Is there anything else that can be used instead of general anesthesia? What can be done to prevent vomiting? Currently, I am on medication for Hashimotos thyroiditis and Compounding cream for menopause.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
General anesthesia has known post aesthesia effects of nausea, retching, vomiting, etc. Also, these may be due to the direct effect of surgery and pain. You seem to be very sensitive and anxious about it. But usually, it is seen that with each subsequent episode of administration of general anesthesia, these effects tend to decrease in severity. If last time you had vomiting post-anesthesia, it will be less severe in terms of the number of episodes, reducing your discomfort if you may have a preexisting gastroduodenal ulcer, gastritis. So I would advise you to discuss issues with your anesthesiologist and surgeon. Nausea, vomiting can be taken care of by medicines like proton pump inhibitors, antiemetics which will be given by your physician in recommended doses. Take a light, non-oily meal on the day before surgery so that stomach stays relatively acid-free.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 93, 'clinical_accuracy': 19, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 9, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hi doctor,
I have been having trouble pronouncing words correctly and feel that my voice is restricted due to mucus in my throat. There are certain times, especially when I am eating when I have a runny nose, and this is when I find that it is much easier to speak freely and maintain a consistent voice. If I take medications to thin the mucus in my throat, it makes it even more difficult to speak. But, when I suck on hard candy, it is easier to speak. I can still talk but it is very uncomfortable because I cannot speak with the inflections that I want or the tone of voice that I want because I cannot control my voice. An ENT did a laryngoscopy and did not find anything.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
As you have mentioned, your primary complaint is excessive mucus in the throat leading to you having trouble pronouncing words. Your voice gets better when you are eating, or have a runny nose, or on sucking a hard candy. All these things have one thing in common that they dilute the mucus  eating, sucking a candy cause increased salivation, thereby diluting the mucus. That means you have a thick, sticky mucus interfering with your speech, which may be due to sinusitis, chronic pharyngitis, gastro-esophageal reflux disease or environmental factors like cigarette smoke or dust. If you have a tendency to frequently clear your throat, that may be a sign of chronic sinusitis. You may need to get a nasal endoscopy done. A clinical examination of the posterior wall of the pharynx may reveal mucosal changes, suggesting a diagnosis of chronic pharyngitis due to any cause. The treatment will depend upon the cause. For example, chronic rhinosinusitis is treated with antibiotics, antihistaminics like Cetirizine, nasal sprays, etc. Chronic pharyngitis is treated with sometimes antibiotics, throat gargles, antihistaminics, etc. A course of PPI proton pump inhibitors like pantoprazole is required to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease. Whatever may be the cause, important is to stay hydrated by drinking lots of water and avoiding dust or cigarette smoke, etc.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"

Testicular pain is quite common in young adults. Idiopathic orchalgia is due to the pull of cremaster muscles more active in the young. Use scrotal support.

"Hi doctor,
I have some questions about my health, especially regarding hemoglobin. I am a 38-year-old woman and a heavy bleeder during my periods. Lately, I have been feeling tired a lot, and I am wondering if it could be anemia or iron deficiency. Looking back, I have experienced a few phases of low energy. How can I tell if it is related to my hemoglobin levels? Are there signs to watch for? Does a nutrient-packed diet play a role, or should I consider supplements? Considering my history of occasional fatigue, is there a chance it is linked to iron levels? The last time I checked my blood values, they were okay, and that was three months ago. How common is anemia, and what is the deal with iron deficiency? If I need to tweak my diet, what kind of foods should I focus on? I am just trying to understand what is going on and how to get my energy levels back up.","Hi,
I am glad you chose icliniq for your medical-related queries.
I understand your concern.
Actually, hemoglobin levels can be checked at any time. Anyones iron and folic acid levels can be tested as well, and if they are low, medication can be prescribed to bring them back to normal. It is very easy to treat anemia. So if you suspect it, I would suggest you undergo a CBC complete blood count and iron folic acid test again. If there is a deficiency, we can prescribe medication for you. Iron deficiency and hemoglobin levels can be low in females due to bleeding and other reasons. I would suggest you consume a diet rich in protein, such as eggs, green vegetables, and dry fruits, and drink plenty of juice throughout the day. All these things will help increase your hemoglobin levels. In addition ,if you can eat red meat, that would be great, as red meat contains plenty of vitamin B12, which helps in treating anemia. So, first of all, I would suggest you check your levels, and then, if needed, we can prescribe medication for you.
I hope this has helped you. Please feel free to reach me again, in case of further queries.

"Hi doctor,Before two months, I took I-pill within two hours of sex as my protection got ruptured. At that time, my periods came before a week of my expected date. After 25 days, I did sex and took an I-pill on that day again. After that, I started to have withdrawal bleeding after a week and it continued for four days with a heavy flow. On the next cycle, my menstruation got delayed and my periods came after ten days. Normally my periods get delayed every month for a week. After a month, we tried fingering and I had bleeding with a light spotting. I got periods after that and I am worried about pregnancy now. Is it possible for the semen to enter into me when it is spilled on my bed sheets or toilet seats? He did not ejaculate into my vagina and some of the semen was leaked on the bedsheet. Please help me.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern. For getting pregnant, sperms are needed to be ejaculated inside the vagina of the female. These sperms have to fertilize the egg. The fertilized egg has to be implanted into the uterus of the female. When these actions happen successfully, then a female becomes pregnant. In your case, you have taken an emergency contraceptive pill and so there is no risk of pregnancy. As you had sex and got periods after a month, this indicates that you are not pregnant. Sperms do not survive in open air for more than a few seconds. So they cannot enter the vagina and swim through the cervix to fertilize the egg. As you have taken I-pill Levonorgestrel twice, it has changed your menstrual pattern. Delay in periods can also occur due to several reasons such as stress, polycystic ovaries, obesity, and pregnancy. Avoid having stress. Please mention whether you have symptoms of PCOS polycystic ovarian disease such as acne, thinning of scalp and hair, and weight gain. For clearing the fear of pregnancy, you can do a urine pregnancy test with the first urine of the day to have accurate results. Do not drink too much fluid prior to the test. Kindly adhere to the guidelines mentioned on the package of the kit. Kindly share the results to guide you further.","{'score': 94, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 96, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I thoroughly read your query and understand your concern.
Kindly screen yourself for clinical depression. Do a self-rating test of depression like Zungs self-rating depression scale, which you can easily find online, and if it is indicative of depression, consult a psychiatrist, either on this platform or nearby. You are having a tough time, but this phase will pass. You will be fine. I suggest certain simple steps that can be of help
1. Meditation daily for at least half an hour in the morning helps.
2. Share your feelings with family or close friends, as sharing helps. If that is not feasible, maintain a stress diary, log down your thoughts daily uncensored, and never read them again.
3. You can also join a self-help group online or offline.
Remember every problem has a solution. You just need to try solving it, and help is just a step away. You can also engage in talk therapy with a clinical psychologist.
Hope this helps.

"Hi doctor,
After returning from a family gathering in my native country last month, I have had a fever, headache, rashes on my arms and legs, and a sore throat. I want to know if these are symptoms of a COVID-19 or Nipah infection? I have not lost any taste or smell senses. I am confused.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern.
Your symptoms appear to be due to a viral or bacterial respiratory infection. COVID-19, influenza, or monkeypox may have induced it. If you have visited an endemic area, it might be the Nipah virus. Nipah virus NiV infection can cause mild to severe disease. Symptoms arise 4 to 14 days after the virus exposure. The symptoms include fever and headache for 3 to 14 days and respiratory infections such as cough, sore throat, and trouble breathing. Following this, brain swelling encephalitis may occur with symptoms such as tiredness, disorientation, and mental confusion, which sometimes can quickly progress to coma within 24 to 48 hours. Because you have rashes, it is conceivable that you may have monkeypox. Fever, malaise, headache, weakness, and other symptoms were initially seen during the prodromal phase. The development of enlarged lymph nodes lymphadenopathy may be widespread involving many distinct regions on the body or restricted to certain areas for example., neck and armpit. Shortly after, a rash appears. Lesions typically begin to develop simultaneously and evolve together in any given part of the body. Lesions proceed through four phases before being scanned and resolved. Typically, the disease lasts 2 to 4 weeks. The rashes could be due to other viral illnesses. Kindly attach the images of the rashes and medical records for further evaluation. For now, I suggest you take these medications for fever. Tablet Paracetamol 650 mg once daily if required when the body temperature is more than 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit. And tablet Montair LC Montelukast 10mg and Levocetirizine 5mg once daily for seven days.","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"

Did you consult a psychiatrist before this consultation for your problem?
Since when have you been married? Was this problem since marriage? Or there was a time of normality between marriage and start of this problem?
If there was a time of normality then what was its duration? Is erection proper?
What is the frequency of intercourse? Do you have this problem of premature ejaculation every time you do sexual intercourse?
Do you suffer from any medical or psychiatric problem? If yes then what and since when?
Are there any medications which you are taking? If yes what and since when?
What is the approximate time you take to ejaculate after penetration? Do you feel tense or anxious during sexual intercourse?
How is your general health and nutritional status? Are you addicted to any substances?
Do you have any family history of medical or psychiatric problem?

Welcome to icliniq.com. Your concern is valid. cirrhosis typically develops gradually and isnt likely to occur within a couple of weeks. It seems improbable that cirrhosis could manifest in such a short timeframe. Its possible that there might be an error in interpreting one of the scan reports. While subtle roughness might raise suspicion, it doesnt definitively confirm cirrhosis. Based on the information provided, Im not entirely convinced of a cirrhosis diagnosis, but I also advise against ignoring the situation. You have two options to consider either wait for three weeks and repeat the CAT scan or proceed directly with a liver biopsy.

This is dependent on multiple factors like age, associated illness, computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI findings, surgery, post injury rehabilitation, etc. Thus, it is difficult to answer this question without all this information.","{'score': 93, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Since you followed the Yuzpe method, the problem may be due to hormone imbalance or infection of either the urinary tract or pelvic floor.
If you have doubts regarding pregnancy, go for a urine pregnancy test in the early morning urine sample and the following tests if possible.
1 Thyroid profile.
2 PAP papanicolaou smear of vaginal discharge for microbiology and others like cervicitis.
3 Urine routine and culture test.
4 Hb hemoglobin level and peripheral smear study.
5 Ultrasound of abdomen and pelvis.
This will narrow down your problem.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Probably you are suffering from a eustachian tube block, acute suppurative otitis media ASOM, or middle ear infection. Avoid cool drinks and ice creams. Use salt water gargling thrice a day for five days. Use steam inhalation thrice a day for five days. Use decongestant nasal spray like Nasivion Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride. Use tablet Levocetirizine with Phenylephrine twice a day after food. If symptoms have not improved, please consult your ENT ear, nose, and throat specialist.

"Hello doctor,
I have very sensitive skin and have been struggling with acne for several years. From the picture I have shared with you ironically, it is the best it has been in a while. On my cheek, I have blackheads, acne scarring, redness, and dull and tired skin. For me, this is my worst area. I also have redness and blackhead on my nose, sides of the forehead, around the mouth, and jawline. I find that my skin seems to have excess oil in some and then dry in others making it difficult to find a product that works for it. In the morning I currently use face wash and moisturizer. At night I use the same face wash. I am using the oil control every other day and I also use Epiduo gel Adapalene and Benzoyl peroxide. When I have particularly dry skin, I use commercial deep moisture comfort balm. Also once or twice I use either energizing scrub or organic olive and aloe scrub for gentle facial peeling. Also about once a month I use a dead sea mud mask. For me, I think the main issue is the acne scarring and redness of my cheeks and my dull tired complexion. Kindly suggest.
Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have read your query and understand your concern. Post-acne scars are of three types box scars, icepick pinpoint scars, and rolling scars. Pinpoint scars are difficult to treat while box scars are easy. I would like to suggest the following
1. No cream or tablet can help you out with scars.
2. Best technique is CO2 fractional laser plus subcision a surgical procedure to remove acne scars. It takes about five to six sittings but results are better than any other procedure.
3. Derma roller plus subcision is another technique but less effective than above.
3. Fillers have a hiding effect that fills the pits and gives an impression of fullness but it is not permanent.
4. Chemical peels can be effective if scars are not much prominent.
These are techniques you can go through. All of them will take four to six sittings and do it for five to six months for better results.
For dull complexion
1. Avoid direct sunlight exposure as much as you can. Wear sunglasses, and caps to cover the exposed parts of the body all the time.
2. Use sunscreen thrice a day like 10 oclock, 12, and 3 oclock all over your face.
3. Sunscreen SPF sun protection factor should be around 50.
4. Use anti-pigmentation cream over pigmented parts like Kojic acid Glycolic acid, Hydroquinone Capryloyl Glycine and Glycerin, or Depiwhite Glyceryl Stearate and Cetearyl Alcohol cream.
5. If tanning is deep and too much then the ideal treatment is glycolic acid peels. That requires sittings of six to eight peels
6. Never stop sunscreen even if tanning goes off.
I hope this will help you.
Thank you.","{'score': 96, 'clinical_accuracy': 19, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"

A bruise is due to tissue bleeding and is usually bluish or bluish-red. It is never yellow. Moreover, a bruise is never itchy. Therefore the condition that you have is not a bruise, and it is something else. I would keep a possibility of either eczematous dermatitis, tinea, or fungal infection.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
No, fluctuations in a heartbeat do not denote any heart disease. In fact, it indicates that your heart is normal. Heartbeat should increase during awake, with activities and exercise. And, it should decrease with rest and sleep. However, you measures the pulse during rest and ask someone to do it during your sleep. The only concern is that it should not be too low. Here, the readings you mentioned are fine. Just to be on a safer side monitor your lowest pulse rate. I guess you do not have any symptoms like dizziness, fainting, palpitations, etc. In all probabilities, there is no abnormality in you and no need to worry.","{'score': 56, 'clinical_accuracy': 10, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 5, 'transparency': 8}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 84, 'clinical_accuracy': 19, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}"

Welcome to icliniq.com.
The medicine for high blood pressure you have been prescribed can not be stopped abruptly, and you should not forget to take it. Be it 30 or 20, If you have been evaluated and now been prescribed, you will have to take the drug. Just one thing I will make clear is, reduce your weight. Reduce the cholesterol with the drug you have been prescribed, which works efficiently, and your blood pressure readings will come down naturally. And the blood pressure medicine will give good result.
One more thing, do not panic and start some lifestyle changes which I will be suggesting to you gradually along with the medicines your doctor has prescribed. You will be able to maintain your vitals at a normal level without the drugs. You will have to have some patience and discipline. There are many programs and surveys done which prove that even some lifestyle changes can cure even patients of high-level coronary blockage.

"Hello doctor,
I feel that I am a complicated case and I am trying to figure out the best way to titrate my oxygen treatment. I have late-stage cystic fibrosis, and I am experiencing a few months of exacerbation that has led to me needing oxygen full time. A few weeks ago I began, for the first time, to titrate my oxygen O2 saturation vigilantly to between 90-95, to combat Co2 retention. Previously, even when sick and using O2 full time, I had not retained carbon dioxide Co2. But on my recent emergency room ER visit when I was in pulmonary distress very short of breath my pCo2 was 65. I was advised to titrate it. I had been advised before, but I had not always done so rigorously, because frankly it just felt uncomfortable. This time I stuck to it, however, because I was very nervous about increased Co2 retention. My pCo2 has wavered around, from 65-62-57-62-58, in about three weeks. The thing that has significantly changed, however, is that I am no longer sensitive to low oxygen saturation. My breathing is much more shallow, and I can sit comfortably at 90 and not even feel bad. It is scary because I can also be walking around and desaturating to 85 without even feeling it. I used to be able to know my oxygen saturation just by feel and how short of breath I was. My breathing, as I said, is very shallow even as I desaturate. It is only when I exercise to a certain point, at high levels of O2, that I am able to inhale and exhale involuntarily and deeply. I have some different issues that make me wonder if the protocol for titrating oxygen at low saturations for Co2 retention is the right treatment for me, and I am going in circles trying to figure it out. My doctors do not seem too concerned about my Co2 retention in general, given my late-stage CF and that I am about to be listed for a transplant, but I always want to figure out what is the best thing to be doing. I have a right to left pulmonary shunt. It is demonstrated when I lie down. My O2 saturation actually rises while lying down, and rises higher if I lie on my left side vs right. So I believe that this would be a component in that venous blood is being recycled into arterial blood but I do not have a grasp of how that could effect Co2 retention only that it can lower my O2 saturation. Secondly, I am very anemic. My hemoglobin has dropped from 9-7 gdL in the recent three weeks. I have always been anemic, but I have become even more so in the past three weeks, despite having been sick with exacerbations for months. The last three weeks have been different. For example, I am also experiencing low magnesium for the first time, and we keep supplementing, but I cannot get my levels up. Lastly, my lungs have improved and infection has cleared somewhat, but I have not been able to come closer at all to being off oxygen. I know I do need to accept that maybe this is not a reality. But regardless, my O2 needs are lower, yet as soon as I exercise or move around even a little, they drop rapidly. Before three weeks, it was much less extreme. Now, I can sit resting on 1 liter and have a saturation of 97, yet as soon as I get up and move for 15 seconds, it drops quickly to the 80s. There are all these components, lungs shot, anemia no red blood cells to carry, and pulmonary shunt diversion of oxygenated blood, that I am trying to piece together to figure out if titrating my oxygen to lower numbers is actually helping me or hurting me?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com. Well, that was a wonderful and well-detailed query. I will answer your query in parts. Regarding  your insensitivity to low oxygen O2 saturation  Well, this is an expected development in long-standing lung problems. Continuous exposure to low oxygen levels over long time will decrease the brains sensitivity for low oxygen and hence that is the reason you breathe shallow in spite of desaturation.   So the bodys next line of defense for low oxygen is carbon dioxide CO2. When the brains sensitivity to oxygen is reduced then the brain uses CO2 level to trigger breathing. But because of your advanced cystic fibrosis exchange of Co2 and O2 is not happening adequately at the lung level and hence your body is retaining Co2 because it is not able to remove it out.   My advice at this point is to do breathing exercises, take long inhalation and long exhalation. Also, do incentive spirometry exercise. Coming to your hypothesis of right to left shunt you are absolutely right. But shunting could be at the lung level or at the heart level. In your case, the chances of shunt being at lung are more likely but still, tests should be done so that there is no shunting at the heart. For that, I advise you get echo with contrast with positional change maneuver. If your  venous blood is being recycled into arterial blood then the total Co2 content of the blood increase as venous blood contains more CO2 than arterial and thus the Co2 gradient the difference between arterial Co2 and alveolar or in simple terms lung Co2 decrease and Co2 elimination is directly dependent on Co2 gradient. Higher the gradient more the elimination and less retention and vice versa. Anemia contributing to O2 desaturation and Co2 retention   If you are anemic then your blood carries less O2 so at rest your O2 demands would be less but on exercise your O2 demands increase a lot which cannot be met due to low O2 carrying capacity of your blood, thus leading to profound O2 desaturation.   But what is not know is why are you suffering from anemia? What is the cause? Because if we can correct your anemia your O2 requirement even on exercise can come down. I advise if any evaluation from your anemia point of view has been done kindly upload so that I can help further.  Until your cardiac evaluation for intra cardiac shunt and anemia evaluation are completed, I advise you to keep titrating your O2 to maintain spo2  95 both at rest and on mild exercise. Till correction of any shunt if possible and correction of anemia is done you will desaturate on exercise and hence increase O2 during exercise.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 96, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"

I do not have a fever or cough. Kindly advice.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
From your description, it seems that you are suffering from allergic rhinitis and mild intermittent asthma. From the symptoms, it is very obvious that the symptoms like nasal irritation and frequent sneezing are because of nasal allergy. You have already completed the antibiotic course so it is not advisable to repeat it again. Start Avamys nasal spray Fluticasone furoate one puff twice daily in each nostril and continue Montair-LC Montelukast and Cetirizine for the time being. Nasivion nasal spray can be taken as required. Formonide inhaler must be continued if you have a cough and breathing difficulty disturbing your daily activities.
You should always gargle after taking the Formonide inhaler every time. You should try to find out and avoid the allergy trigger responsible for your symptoms. Once you start taking these medicines regularly all your symptoms will automatically get controlled. In case of no improvement, you should visit your local pulmonologist to find out any other pathology.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 80, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 5, 'transparency': 9}"

"Hello doctor, My 5-year-old kid has had swollen lymph nodes on his neck for over ten weeks.

The doctor said it was good that we came and gave him antibiotics and did not do blood work, etc. As I am giving my healthy kid antibiotics, I ask myself what is the reason for an antibiotic if the doctor did not do blood work or confirmed that he has a bacterial infection that caused swollen lymph.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern.
Please note that it is normal for children below the age of eight years to have such swollen lymph nodes intermittently during times of illness. The most common viral cause of swollen lymph nodes is EBV Ebstein Barr virus. However, a course of antibiotics is worth a try. If, after four days of antibiotics, things do not improve at all, then investigations may be required depending on the clinical scenario. Investigations suggestions for this particular case are mentioned below.
CBC complete blood count.
CRP C-reactive protein, quantitative.
PSMP peripheral smear for the malarial parasite.
Dengue NS1 antigen detection.
IgG immunoglobulin G and IgM evaluation.
SGPT serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase.
Urine routine and microscopy.
EBV VCA IgM anti-Epstein-Barr virus capsid antigen IgM.
TB tuberculosis IGRA interferon-gamma release assays.
Lymph node biopsy is usually not suggested but may be decided based on the above investigations and clinical scenarios.

And doctor decided to do Cath and shows normal instead of 60 and said it is not important and I can share the results. I experienced uncontrolled hypertension even with the same medication and did many lab tests. My doctor changed Exforge to Vocado 401025. I could not tolerate it, and my heartbeat becomes fast and uncomfortable all the time. Then I returned by myself to Exforge 5160 and Nebilet and started measuring my BP daily for one week after working hours and having my main meal and rest for 30 minutes. I have attached my one weeks blood report. 14595 mmHg, 12575 mmHg, 13090 mmHg, 14090 mmHg, 14090 mmHg, and 15090 mmHg. But I still feel uncomfortable as sometimes I feel too hard to breathe only, so I need advice and a second opinion","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have read your query and all your lab reports attachment removed to protect patient identity and found all are normal. I can understand your concerns and worries and pain you are going through. Your doctor wanted to dig the secondary cause of uncontrolled blood pressure, so he asked you for this vast number of tests, and fortunately, the tests are normal. Some points should be put in mind for blood pressure. Blood pressure is a dynamic entity and keeps on changing from time to time and from activity to activity. For example, blood pressure will be higher when one does vigorous exercise or under stress and will be lower when one is relaxed or sleeping. Blood pressure readings will be incorrect if measuring blood pressure is not optimal or if the patient is not fully relaxed. Adherence to a medication regimen is a must, along with lifestyle modifications, dietary modifications, and stress management, including proper uninterrupted sleep. Your blood pressure readings are slightly above the target. Reduce weight. Do daily exercise. Adopt an active lifestyle and refrain from sedentary behavior. Take a Mediterranean diet and take proper sleep uninterrupted. Escalate the dose from 5160 to 10160 and continue Nebivolol. Assess blood pressure over a few weeks of all these measures. Your blood pressure will reach targets soon.","{'score': 92, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 93, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}"

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I went through your query and understood your concern.
Fear and avoidance of social situations can be a part of your personality. The more you avoid, the worse your fear can get over you. I suggest you have at least one close friend with whom you can confide in your problems. In this way, you will be in comfort and will face less anxiety in social situations. Prefer to be in a group and not isolate yourself. Slowly, you will get over it. I also suggest you take a tablet of Panazep Paroxetine and Clonazepam 25 milligrams at night for a period of two weeks to help you ward off your anxiety. Kindly consult a specialist, talk with them, and take medicines with their consent. I hope this has helped you.

"Hi doctor,
I am being advised to terminate the desired pregnancy because of the medication I have been prescribed to tackle a virus that I got just after becoming pregnant. I am looking for a second medical opinion on whether termination is necessary. I would like to understand the risks to the fetus of being exposed to the herpes zoster virus in the first month of pregnancy and the risks of the medication including steroids that I am on at this stage in pregnancy. Here are the details of the timings and medications.
I had my last period on the 26th two months back, and I ovulated on the 13th of last month. 20th of last month, I had Ramsay Hunt Syndrome inner ear pain and right side facial paralysis, and on 21st, I was diagnosed with Bells palsy, for which I was prescribed Prednisolone. I took 30 mg, 25 mg, and 20 mg of Prednisolone, respectively, on the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th. The symptoms got worse, including outer ear pain and rash. And I was diagnosed with herpes zoster virus, and I was given Vitamin B12 injection. From the 24th to the 31st, I took Famciclovir 6 x 250 mg tablets per day. From 25th to 27th, I took Dexamethasone injections of 10 mg per day for three days.
From the 28th to the 31st, I took Prednisolone 30 mg per day. On the 29th of last month, pregnancy was confirmed. From the first to the fourth of this month, I had Prednisolone 20 mg per day and 10 mg for the next four days. From the 26th of last month, I took daily injections of vitamin B1 and B12, and I used Acyclovir 3  topical cream on the ear.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
The increased exposure to corticosteroids can cross the placental barrier and cause adrenal suppression in the fetus. This can lead to salt wasting, electrolyte imbalances, and even poor development of the fetus. The organs can also have improper development, and anomalies can be possible. It can also lead to sexual organ development disorders in the case of a male fetus. It would be safer to go in for a termination, as it is still in the early months of pregnancy. Also, exposure to herpes zoster can cause scarring of the face, limb, and organ deformities in the fetus.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 92, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"

"Hello doctor,I am having symptoms of urinary frequency after antibiotic treatment for chlamydia. I have taken antibiotics Azithromycin and an incomplete course of Ciprofloxacin.

Sorry to hear about your troubles. Your doctor is correct that it can take some time for the urethra to heal from the inflammation urethritis after an STD sexually transmitted disease infection. For some, it will clear up in a month, but for others, it will take up to two to three months.
I suggest you stop the antibiotics once the prescribed duration is over.  However, Flomax Ofloxacin, even though it affects ejaculation, is the correct treatment going forward, at least for a couple of months. Drink at least 101 fluid ounces of water per day.Avoid sitting for prolonged periods in one go.
Depending on your country of residence, add the following drugs
Tablet Trypsin Chymotrypsin thrice daily.
Tablet Cranpac D Cranberry and D Mannose once daily in the morning.
A probiotic tablet once daily in the morning.
Tablet Mirabegron 25 mg once daily in the morning.
Take all the above medications for one month. Consult a specialist doctor, talk to them, and then take the medicine. Whether you can get these medications with my prescription depends on the local policy of your country. You may have to see your General practitioner to get a prescription. Regardless, be assured this will settle down with time.

Firstly, ectopics in this age are benign and not worrisome. I guess they are confirmed on Holter and assumed to be ventricular ectopics. And also ruled out the structural heart disease on echo.

It has not returned since, but I noticed a dull pain every once in a while in my penis after that incident. Kindly help.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
The two main reasons for burning sensation and pain after ejaculation are infection in the prostate, or allergy to rubbing agent during masturbation. Prostatitis is one frequent issue in males. It is the inflammation of the prostate due to infection. A semen culture is needed to find a prostate infection. Once the infection is identified, the treatment can be started with antibiotics, and the course of treatment is about four weeks. The choice of antibiotic depends on the culture result. Secondly, suppose you got burning, especially at the tip of the penis. In that case, there might be inflammation due to the agent used in rubbing the penis during masturbation, and we need to change the agent or use olive oil instead.

Epididymoorchitis is a painful condition and not really mild pain.

Did this problem happened before, do you have any urinary complaints or difficulties passing urine? Did you have a urine culture done? Are you sexually active?  Any blood in urine or ejaculation?

The standard thickness of the nasal bone ranges between 1.5 to 2.5 mm. Your fetal nasal bone thickness is less for the gestation period, and the presence of echogenic focus in the left ventricle indicates endocardial cushion defect, which is seen in the case of Downs syndrome. It is advisable that you should opt for a non-invasive prenatal testing or amniocentesis for FISH fluorescent in situ hybridization study, which can ascertain the fetal karyotype and trisomy 21 can be conclusively ruled out.

Welcome to icliniq.com. Heart rate and bowel movements typically have no direct correlation, although anxiety can cause an increase in heart rate. An upset stomach can induce stress in the body, potentially resulting in a rapid heartbeat. Its important to note that the maximum limit for heart rate increase is typically calculated as 220 minus your age.

ED erectile dysfunction can have many causes. One of them is low testosterone.

"Hi doctor,
I would like to know what does my lab tells you about my current  liver function.
I began to struggle with daily gout pain a few months ago and finally gave in to taking the traditional drugs about one and a half months ago. Both Allopurinol and Probenecid caused worrisome impacts on my body. I began to experience flank pain, confused thinking, and fatigue. Around this time, I was also compelled to have my A1C checked because I was struggling with headaches, insomnia, and various degrees of itching after eating. My A1C turned out to be 5.7.
I stopped taking the drugs, and did a lot of research, and was fortunate to find some supplements that seem to be effective at the intersection of both metabolic syndrome and gout. Presently, I have found that Berberine approximately 1000 mgday works. Gout pain is essentially gone, and blood sugar seems to be coming under control with each day, though my caloric intake in unsustainably low. Admittedly, I have taken some Hesperidin, ALA, chromium, NAC, ECGC, nigella sativa oil, or triple strength turmeric occasionally when I was having a momentary concern not all at once, or even all in a day, but occasionally.
My concern is for my ongoing liver function. Though things seem to be getting better, as the day goes on and I have taken some supplements, I will start to feel pressure in the middle of my back, kidney area, and left flank discomfort. It tends to have gone away by the time I wake up in the morning. On looking at my labs, the markers for liver function have fluctuated, but my primary care doctor never made mention of them. Is there anything you can tell me about what the changes in these ratios say?","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have seen your blood works. attachment removed to protect patient identity. It is all normal. Usually, during the acute attack of gout, we do not start Allopurinol or uric acid decreasing medications as it can exaggerate the situation. We usually start after the acute situation is treated with drugs like NSAIDs non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Allopurinol is started with caution if there is liver disease, kidney disease, diabetes, congestive heart failure, and high blood pressure. Are you pregnant or breastfeeding? Are you receiving chemotherapy drugs? Allopurinol can decrease the number of blood cells in your body that causes blood clot and that help you fight infections, which can make it easier for you to bleed from an injury or get sick when exposed to others who are ill. It can increase liver enzymes to decrease the blood elements. But I have seen your blood works and it is fine.
If someone has kidney stones due to increased uric acid, or recurrent gout episodes, or uric acid deposition on soft tissues that is the time usually Allopurinol is started and continued I think you do not have these problems. You need to decrease your protein intake like less meats, fish, lentils, eggs, and avoid diuretics which are used to treat high blood pressure. Alcohol intake to be reduced as well. You told your HBA1c glycated hemoglobin is 5.7 that is pre-diabetes or borderline diabetes, so better check your fasting sugar and sugar after two hours of eating. You need to do exercise even if it is just walking for one hour daily. Stop or reduce carbohydrates especially sugar in tea and sugary juices, bread, rice, pasta, and potatoes. Intermittent fasting can also help in decreasing weight and controlling sugar. Lifestyle modifications can help a lot in your case.

"Hi doctor,I am trying to hydrate my skin and to get rid of small bumps present on my skin. I wonder when I use micellar water for makeup removal, toner, and astringent pads.","Hi,

Both toners and astringents are used to remove makeup and cleanser residue that is left on the skin after washing the face. Both are water-based products. But there are some differences between these two products. Toners contain glycerin and other humectants. They help to hydrate the skin and your skin feels softer after using it. On the other hand, astringents are formulated to remove excess oil from your skin. It is like a stronger form of toner. So if you have oily skin, you can go for it.

"Hello doctor,I had protected intercourse only two days after my period ended. Then, I took an emergency contraceptive pill just to be sure. After five days, I experienced menstrual bleeding. Is this normal? Is there any chance I could be pregnant? Kindly help.Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I read your query and can understand your concern.
There is no probability of conception because after two days of periods, the egg was no longer available, you had used protection, you had an emergency tablet, and you were already bleeding. For women, ovulation normally happens between the twelfth and sixteenth day of their menstruation. An egg has a life of twenty-four hours, while sperm has a life of seventy-two hours. So, there was no likelihood that the egg would be ready for sperm, and sperm would not be available for the following ovulation.
The emergency tablets contain a large amount of progesterone hormone, which is produced in your body in the second half of the period following ovulation. This pill will suddenly thicken the inner lining of the uterus, making it unsuitable for a probable pregnancy to occur. Because it is a single dose, it has no strength to stand on, so it comes off, and you get a period or bleeding of greater thickness within 7 to 10 days. It is a highly effective approach, although it disrupts hormonal balance and menstruation. So, I suggest trying alternative approaches first and just utilizing E-Pill Levonorgestrel as a last resort.
I hope this information will help you.

"Hi doctor,
I have a 10 cm hiatus hernia. I have been under a specialist for 12 months now. I had two endoscopic procedures done, one under GA, but my gullet was not opening and was severely inflamed. On the CT scan, it shows a dark shaded area. The consultant could not get to see a closer picture or to take biopsies from this area in question. My symptoms are serious stomach and back pain, loss of appetite, pale stools, clay-like dark urine with odor, occasional sickness after eating, cold and hot sweats, warm tummy, cold chest, and legs.

I understand your concern. The condition is known as Tinea cruris, Jock itch, or dermatophytosis. It is a type of superficial skin infection.

Take Capsule Itraconazole Sporanox 100 mg twice a day. Use Cream Luliconazole apply once at night. Take Tablet Levocetirizine Xyzal 5 mg once at night. Stop using Travocor Isoconazole nitrate 10 mg and Diflucortolone valerate 1 mg cream. It is very harmful to this type of infection as it has potent steroid.

Welcome to Icliniq.com.
I understand your concern.
Your child, who is around 18 months old, is formula-fed through a bottle and nipple. But now he has a problem accepting the same. Since you are giving formula feed, you always have a choice to shift to other formula feed available from different brands. However, you should encourage your child to accept milk from a glass now, as it is the right time to stop bottle feeding. Next, I would suggest you switch over to dairy milk, if it is acceptable to the child. Another important thing is to focus on complementary feed now, that is providing adequate nutrition in the form of cereals, pulses, vegetables, fruits, and various protein sources. All in a palatable form.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
For URTI upper respiratory tract infection, I advise taking an antibiotic like Azithromycin only in case you have a persisting fever. Otherwise, in most cases, URTI is due to viral infection and it gets better within five days. You should take an antiallergic like Levocetirizine which is available as OTC over the counter drug.
You should do warm saline gargles at least three to four times a day and do steam inhalation. Drink plenty of hot fluids to give your throat soothing and help in pain. Share my opinion with your doctor before you act upon it.
I would say you can take tablet Combiflam Ibuprofen and Paracetamol for the headache. You can continue his medicines for next three days and do steam inhalation and gargles. You would get fine in next two to three days.

"Hello doctor,
I am a 37-year-old and have a history of PMH - chronic rhinitis with polyposis. I have suffered from the mentioned disease for 12 years, which is controlled with Mometasone and occasionally Fluticasone drops. I also take an antihistamine regularly, which helps even though my IgE allergy testing was negative. I had two questions when I previously saw an ENT a year ago, they discovered grade 1 polyps and performed a sinus CT scan, which revealed minor inflammation that they did not consider severe enough to warrant surgery. The specialist reported there were no polyps during the follow-up nasendoscopy.I had been taking the steroid drops Flixonase, which probably helped. I am currently using Mometasone nasal spray, but my nose remains incredibly clogged at night, forcing me to breathe through my mouth. Vicks nasal spray is quite helpful, however, I am afraid to use it because of the rebound effect. How many consecutive nights can I take Vicks nasal spray safely? I also utilized an ear wax camera to look up my nostril. I know I should not have done it, but I noticed a red spot on a stalk and was wondering if it was a polyp. Or is it merely a byproduct of the turbinate? I have uploaded a picture.
Please help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
A solid endoscopy to rule out polyps is the greatest thing that can be done. The ear wax camera is not decisive, even if at first glance it appears to be a turbinate since polyps are normally white and pale, and the nasal steroids are continued. If used for more than 14 days, Vicks nasal spray can produce rhinitis medica-mentors and create reflex congestion, therefore please discontinue use. If you have CRS cytokine release syndrome with nasal polyps, it is usually recommended that you see your ENT ear nose, and throat specialist once a year and have a thorough endoscopy done since a brief course of oral steroids may be required if the polyps have grown in size and if you have AFRS allergic fungal rhinosinusitis. I suggest you take a capsule of Itraconazole oral triazoles should also help, and you should try to get your Mometasone nasal spray Mometasone furoate switched to Budesonide nasal spray micronized budesonide, which has a better effect.
I hope this helps.

As she had a withdrawal bleed post Unwanted 72 intake and also the urine pregnancy test has been negative till date, so pregnancy is ruled out.

"Hello doctor,
I slipped, fell and landed on my side four days ago and have been in a lot of pain since then, around my ribs on the left side. The pain has not lessened, sometimes feels worse. It hurts when I breathe so I have to take shallow breaths. I know that X-rays will not do much and I realize that not much can really be done at all. So my question is what can I do to help the healing process or if there is anything I should not be doing. I have been going to work and avoiding heavy lifting. I cannot really afford to take more than a few days off. Would it slow the process of healing if I continue to go to work but avoid heavy lifting and any strenuous activity?","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concern. Severe pain in the ribs and breathing difficulty after a fall indicates some injury to the ribs. Even a minor fracture of the ribs can cause severe pain and breathing difficulty. Sometimes, severe muscular spasm following a fall can also cause such symptoms. So you need a proper physical examination. As you mentioned that you fell on the left side and having severe pain and breathing difficulty also, I suggest you get an X-ray done and consult an orthopedician. It is true that X-ray will not help much but you can get it done to make sure that there is no rib fracture. For minor rib fracture, only conservative management should be done. You need to take rest, avoid excessive spine movements, avoid sleeping on left side, avoid lifting heavy weights. In my opinion, you should take rest and avoid working for a few days. I would suggest you take some oral anti-inflammatory drug in combination with muscle relaxant drug twice daily for about five days. You can also apply some analgesic cream or ointment twice daily. Also, apply hot water bag over the painful area for 20 minutes thrice daily for pain relief. I hope this helps. Thank you and take care.

"Hello doctor,I gave birth to my baby just two months ago, and I started having sex in the third week after delivery. Three more weeks later at six weeks postpartum, I received the birth control shot. However, the doctor did not perform a pregnancy test before administering the shot.

I also felt a bit nauseous the day before getting the shot, but I assumed it was related to my hormones returning to normal. I have taken pregnancy tests, and they either show inaccurate or not pregnant. In my last two pregnancies, I felt the same way after two weeks of being pregnant, but the tests came back negative. Is there a possibility that I could be pregnant, but it is not showing up due to the birth control shot?

Such type of cough is called allergic cough which occurs in a particular time. Gas formation is due to irregular bowel habits.
Advice
Hot saline gargle before breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Stop fried things, it enhances the problem.
Are you hypertensive? Check out your blood pressure also.
Treatment
Tablet Azithromycin 500 mg once every day for three to six days, Nexpro RD 200 mg one before breakfast and dinner, Esmoprezole plus sustained released Domperidon for three days one before breakfast for five days or whenever required.
For irregular bowel habits, take one bowl of salad in the morning and evening. Add curd in lunch. Take buttermilk in the afternoon it is very good for health.
Take husk Isabgol three teaspoons full at night with milk. It is a herbal remedy good for the intestine also. It forms a slimy layer and protects the mucosa of the intestine. You can take it in the morning also. Cough syrup again produces irregular bowel habit. Amrodil-plus one teaspoon full at night is sufficient.

Hypothyroidism does not play a role in determining breast size. Breasts are made up of fat. Girls who have less fat in their body have small size of breasts. There is no medication for increasing the breast size. But I can suggest some ways to increase the size. You can try to do breast increasing exercises and you can take help from a trained professional. Eat a healthy meal. Try to include soya products and proteins in your diet.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
There is absolutely nothing that you need to worry about. 1. Sneezes can often be pungent-smelling in few people, and it is sometimes genetically determined without any underlying condition. However, in your case, the most likely problem could be underlying allergies which could cause stasis of secretions in the sinuses leading to bacterial growth and ketone break down, causing this pungent odor. 2. If you have been asymptomatic or do not have your nose bothering you most of the time, the only thing that you need to do is to douche the nasal cavity with normal saline. It is available in premixed sachets and is marketed as Nasowash, Netiwash, etc. You can douche the nasal cavity to wash out any retained secretions. 3. In a week or two, you should be fine, and the odor should disappear. It would be best to take care of the allergic symptoms by avoiding the triggering factors and wearing an N95 mask whenever you feel you tend to get exposed to those triggering factors. I hope this answers your query. If there is anything more that you need to enquire about, kindly do let me know, and I will get back to you as soon as possible.

Yes, caps are advisable but single is best. Joined or bridge has a drawback. If any side of the joined cap is loose or any damage comes, then the whole bridge is removed.

"Hello doctor,My 14-year-old son recently underwent a gum graft procedure due to a significant gum recession on his lower teeth. Many of these teeth required grafting, and our orthodontist referred him to a periodontist. During the evaluation, it was discovered that his gums were too thin and lacked the necessary strength for braces. The specific grafting technique used, which I believe may have been a free gingival graft, involved removing a substantial amount of tissue from his palate and then stitching it below the lower teeth. His need for braces has been apparent for some time now. Approximately two years ago, our orthodontist postponed placing braces due to the eruption of his twelve-year molars. Seven years ago when his molars had grown in, he was due to receive braces earlier this year. However, the recent gum graft surgery has delayed this process, and he has not yet been cleared for braces.I want to ask the following questionsIs it possible to determine the success of a gum graft after just six to seven weeks, or does it typically take longer, such as six months or more? If so, what factors contribute to this extended healing period?How long does it generally take to get juvenile periodontitis under control and stabilize it to prevent or minimize gum recession? When can one expect clearance from a periodontist for braces after dealing with this condition for a while? In cases of moderate or advanced gum disease with bone loss, when is a bone graft recommended, and is it typically performed in conjunction with a gum graft? At what age does juvenile periodontitis usually begin, and how long do each of its stages last? How quickly can it progress from a moderate to an advanced stage in male teenagers?What usually occurs at a periodontist appointment following the removal of stitches after a gum graft? Are intense cleanings or scalings common, and what are the potential reasons for a less-than-pleasant experience at this appointment?Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern.
Juvenile periodontitis is an autoimmune disorder and can destroy the periodontium around teeth very fast resulting in loose teeth and falling out of teeth. It can occur at any age as it is autoimmune but usually, is seen after all the permanent teeth have erupted fully. If there is much loss of attachment of gums and bone loss, then orthodontic treatment is very difficult. It can be confirmed only by seeing an x-ray and a picture of the area. If the gum graft and bone graft is successful you will know in about six months to one year only. This type of periodontal treatment has about a 50 to 60 percent success rate only, as it is an autoimmune disorder. If you are still unsure send a recent picture of the area and an x-ray for specific analysis. The bad experience one can have is the constant infection of the site and loosening of the gum graft. constant dull pain and sensitivity etc. After a gum graft, orthodontic treatment cannot be started within seven to eight weeks. It has to be reviewed many times to confirm its success. Approximately six months time
I hope this helps. Feel free to contact me if you have any further queries.

"Hi doctor,
This question may come across as a bit of a silly one, but it is been bugging me quite a lot recently. My penis size is around two to three inches. I measured it but was quite surprised when it came up with two to three inches as it does not look like it, but if I wiggle it about or mess around with it, it will generally go between three to four, and in a fully erect condition, it can reach around six inches. Most girls compliment me about it being big and whatnot, but I always try to hide it until I am fully erect as I do not want them to see how small it is when flaccid. Is this normal, and is there anything I can do? It has a thickness to it when it is hard but when flaccid I do not see it.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Following is my opinion on your question.
I have seen the attached photo attachments removed to protect the patients identity. In a flaccid state, a three-inch size is normal. In the picture also, it seems to be around three inches. The size of an erect penis is about six inches. So, you are getting this size in an erection. Womens outer one-third vagina is sensitive during sexual intercourse. So, the sexual feeling is not present in the vagina beyond four to five inches. So, you need not worry about that.

Can you give me some advice on how to quit?
I have heard about nicotine patches and chewing gums do those work?
Are there any medications that can help in this process?
I appreciate any guidance you can provide.
Thank you.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com
Good, you have decided to quit smoking.
The best way to quit smoking is with a combination of medication and counseling. You can buy gum, patches, or lozenges over the counter. There are also prescription medications that may help you quit.
A nicotine nasal spray or inhaler can reduce withdrawal symptoms and make it easier for you to quit smoking. Quitting smoking has health benefits at any age, no matter how long or how much you have smoked.
Patches can provide a steady level of nicotine in the body to help lessen withdrawal, while the gum or lozenge can be used to relieve cravings more quickly as they happen. If you have a lot of desires while using the patch, you may not be using a strong enough dose.
Nicotine gums Those who have been using nicotine gum for over six months tend to complain of recurrent nightmares and disruptive sleep that may lead to other severe health conditions such as obesity, diabetes, fatigue, and overall decreased quality of life. You better go for counseling.

"Hi doctor,
My 2-month-old baby is formula fed and does not latch on my breast. I tried pumping breast milk and got only 30 ml per session. What should I do to increase my milk supply?
Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern.
I suggest you some tips you can consider
1. Frequent Nursing or Pumping Breast milk production works on a supply-and-demand basis. The more you nurse or pump, the more signals your body receives to produce milk. Aim for at least eight to twelve nursing or pumping sessions per day.
2. Proper Latch and Positioning Work with a lactation consultant to ensure your baby is latching correctly when attempting to breastfeed. Proper latch helps stimulate milk production and transfer.
3. Skin-to-Skin Contact Holding your baby skin-to-skin can help stimulate milk production and increase bonding. Try to have as much skin-to-skin contact as possible, even if it is not during feeding times.
4. Pumping After ursing After each nursing session, try to pump for a few extra minutes to encourage more milk production.
5. Stay Hydrated and Well-Nourished Drink plenty of fluids throughout the day and maintain a balanced diet. Some mothers find that foods like oatmeal, fenugreek, and lactation teas or cookies can support milk production, but the evidence for their effectiveness is anecdotal.
6. Minimize Stress Stress can interfere with milk production, so try to relax as much as possible. Find ways to reduce stress in your daily routine, such as practicing deep breathing, meditation, or engaging in activities you enjoy.
7. Consider Using a Breast Pump A high-quality electric breast pump can help you express milk more efficiently than manual pumping. Talk to a lactation consultant or healthcare professional about the best type of pump for your needs.Remember, it is important to consult with a lactation consultant or healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.

Please let me know the circumstances under which this hypothetical situation arose. Sorry, I lack any scientific data addressing your query about consuming vaginal fluid-contaminated milk. Yes, HIV human immunodeficiency virus gets killed by pasteurization. Pasteurized breast milk is a safe alternative feeding for HIV-exposed infants. If you are talking about breast milk, HIV is found in the breast milk, and there are studies in the literature that shows that HIV can cross mucosal tissue in the mouth and upper GI gastrointestinal tract to infect neonates. You have not explained the scenario for risk assessment.

I do not know if it is an abscess or an exposed nerve in my molar that is right behind it. Took Tylenol 2 every 6 hours twice. It did not help. Used Benzocaine on the area. Helped 20 . Do not feel comfortable using it at home.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Is the pain sharp or dull? Any gum swelling? If the pain is sharp, lancinating and referring to the same side jaw, temple, ear or throat, then this could be from the tooth with the chipped out filling. Most chipped out fillings expose the underlying nerve which causes severe pain. Ideally an X-ray is required to determine the depth of the cavity and to check for nerve involvement. If the nerve is involved, a root canal treatment and crown procedure will be done to save that tooth.
If the pain is from the gums and is dull in nature, this could be an accidental gum injury due to flossing or there is a chance of the attempted food deposit to get deeply pushed into the gums causing this pain. If this is the case, a deep localized scaling should be performed under local anaesthesia to relieve any deeply wedged food deposit. A clinical examination and X-ray is required to diagnose the cause of this pain. I see that taking painkillers and topical anaesthetic in this situation were not much of help to you. Please visit your nearby dentist immediately and get the root cause identified. Meanwhile, try warm saline mouth rinses and avoid hot, spicy foods which may aggravate your pain.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 91, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 7, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,
Tea spilled on my thighs last night and I can see swelling filled with water now. I have already applied silverex ointment yesterday night. What should I apply for rapid healing?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Hot beverage spillage usually causes severe burning sensation, but there is no reason to get alarmed if managed properly. From what you have said, I guess that the scalded area is small. If it is so, the first thing you have to do is to apply water and wash the wound. Hope you have already done so.
After that, there should be absolutely no contact with water for the next few days. You have applied Silverex ointment Silver sulfadiazine, which is a wise decision. Apply it twice daily for the next 3-4 days. If the wound is painful, buy Xylocaine Jelly and apply both Xylocaine and Silverex together twice daily.
Scalds usually need open space to heal. No closed dressing is needed.
Regarding the bleb swelling with colorless fluid inside it, buy a sterile needle from a pharmacy and prick it. If more than one bleb is present, prick all of them and let the fluid drain. Apply both the oinments afterwards.
Do not soil the wound. Prevent sand or water falling on the wound. It will cause infection.

"Hello doctor,
I just had my second urolift a week back. My doctor-surgeon pinned down the median lobe of the prostate and removed a bladder stone during that surgery. Had voiding trial two days back. Urinated out about 200 cc at urologists office. I think she put in 300 cc if I recall correctly. Went home and had to come back and be recatheterized at 430 PM. Had 485 cc in. My bladder at that point was able to get a fairly good stream going for a while but then got spasms and just dribbling so the amount out was not good enough to handle the amount of liquid going into the bladder. The head of my penis had stopped bleeding from the surgery but the recatheterization has caused it to start bleeding again. PA wants another voiding trial next week. I am concerned that this is too soon and that the wound inside the head of my penis will never heal and the spasms which do not allow me to accomplish a successful voiding trial will never cease if I am not given enough time to heal. Your thoughts?","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
In urolift, there is no cutting and therefore no wound. The prostate tissue is pinned to its covering and this widens the urine tube. So one weeks rest should be fine for whatever healing there has to occur. The spasms that occur with a catheter in place are due to bladder trying to push out the catheter and these go once the catheter is removed. I think another trial of catheter removal is fine. If it does not work, or you are not happy with the flow or symptoms, or if you have more than 100 to 150 cc residue, better to undergo a formal TURP or HoLEP surgery for the prostate. It is an endoscopically performed, under anesthesia and little side effects. In your case, the urolift is causing problems and this defeats the whole purpose of urolift being less invasive than prostate surgery.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"

Well, it is essential that you start the antibiotics as soon as possible. If you can postpone your holiday and go after the course, then it would be ideal for you. However, if you cannot, then please start as soon as you come back. Having Chlamydia implies there is already a degree of pelvic infection and inflammation, which will be helped to a large degree by the medications. Whether it causes fertility issues or not, it cannot be gauged at the present time. After a few months you can get a hysterosalpingography done to determine the status of your fallopian tubes. Usually, it is not a major issue. You must also contact your current sexual partner if any and any people you may have been in a sexual relationship with over the past three to four years.

Can I continue the last prescription as it is? And also, there is an unusual smile while communicating with others, which creates many difficulties. I cannot stop it. I tried it very hard. I am attaching the prescription file. I do meditation in the morning. Does it has any negative effect, and should I stop it?
The prescription given was,
Tablet Fludac - 20 mg.
Tablet Oleanz - 2.5 mg.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern and the problems encountered by you while discontinuing the medication. At the same time, I am happy to know that you are doing well in many domains with little medication and no problematic side effects other than a possible unusual smile.
As I explained during our first consultation, you need to continue medication for a long time which may last six months and more. If you are having proper relief while taking medication, you can continue the same medication for another month. If you have these intrusive and attention problem thoughts despite taking medication, we have to increase the dose of fluoxetine to 40 mg, which should be taken at the same time as in the past.
Please be reminded that you are not supposed to skip even a single dose as the proper medication is of utmost importance for the complete treatment of your condition.
Regarding your unusual smile, if that is the same thing you described during your first consultation, then there is no problem. I hope with continuing medication, that will get alright. If the unusual smile is a new thing, then probably the side effects of these medicines or something that needs to be investigated. Suppose you do not feel any improvement feel free to contact me.
It is almost very difficult to modify medication with a small piece of information that you described above.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hi doctor,
I am a mother of a 16 year old boy, who is 5.9 feet tall. He has white spots on the back of his throat along with swollen tonsils. He does not have a fever but finds it hard to swallow. Is this strep infection or what is it? He had the same before, and it was told as thrush.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com. Yes, it is mostly a streptococcal infection, which is causing the sore throat and all his symptoms. And if your son has a white or yellowish spot, then it is more likely to be a sore throat than an oral thrush, because an oral thrush forms a uniform membrane rather than spots. Fever may not always present. You can get your son tested for streptococcus infection. I would suggest some advice for your son to try. Betadine gargles four times a day for around five days. Antibiotic capsule Augmentin Amoxycillin and Clavulanic acid 625 mg three times a day for five days. Antacid like tablet Pantoprazole 40 mg before breakfast, once a day for five days. Avoid cold food items. Tablet Paracetamol or Ibuprofen for pain, whenever needed. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start medications after their consent.

"Hello doctor,
I always had a lower left brow causing the lid to appear more droopy than the right side. However, the skin on the left side has recently become thinner in the past year I would say, causing less of my lid to appear and I feel a sensation now on that eye like something is sitting on my lid. I am only 18 so I feel like I should not be having any issues with my eyes yet. However, I did have Hashimotos and thyroid cancer and got the thyroid removed and all of my thyroid levels have been stable since then. However, the skin on my left lid never went back to normal. Also, I feel like I might have a little bit of ptosis in both of my eyes, but it does not obstruct my vision. When I look back at old pictures when I was a baby up until the age of 12, my eyelids appear much more open. So is it normal for eyelids to droop as we age? I am currently on Synthroid.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
You have explained your history nicely. You have not mentioned about photos. Both are recently taken or different. attachment removed to protect patient identity. In the photos attached first one which is showing your lower lids down seems to be taken in a slightly down gaze. That is a normal thing. When we look down lower lid goes down with the eye. While in the second picture light reflex is central in both eyes and lower lids are in normal position. Your both upper lids are in a normal position. Normally upper lids cover 1-2 mm cornea superiorly. I would not say these as droopy lids. While in cases of thyroid disease skin changes occur like skin thinning and dryness. So these sensations could be due to hypersensitive skin. For dryness of the skin around the eye or dry eyes, you can use artificial tears. It seems you are thinking too much about it. No significant changes are seen in your eyes or lids after seeing these photos. Just relax. Nothing to worry about and you are absolutely fine. If these are older photos you can send the latest ones. And do not take photos yourself selfies because it is not taken in primary gaze looking straight.

"Hello doctor,I am a 20-year-old female who is 5 feet 2 inches tall, weighing 143.3 pounds, and I am concerned about lumps in both of my breasts. I have had these firm lumps since I started developing breasts, and they are almost symmetrical on both breasts. There are multiple internal lumps and two big lumps on both breasts except the axilla, these are only felt by palpating but are not visible. I am a second-year medical student therefore I had to perform breast examinations on patients and found that no one else had significant lumps across their breasts. So I am afraid that mine are not typical. For background information, I have tuberous breasts that did not develop correctly and are somewhat smaller. There is no discomfort, discharge, or new alterations in the breasts.Kindly help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I read your query and can understand your concern.
As a medical student, you are understandably concerned about the lumps in your breasts. However, it is essential to remember that breast lumps are common, and not all of them are cancerous. Most breast lumps turn out to be benign non-cancerous conditions such as fibroadenomas, cysts, or fibrocystic changes. Given your medical background, you may have a heightened awareness of breast lumps and may be more sensitive to their presence. However, it is essential to avoid self-diagnosis and seek the advice of a qualified healthcare provider. Here are some steps you can take
Schedule an appointment with your primary care physician or a breast specialist. They can perform a thorough clinical examination and order any necessary diagnostic tests, such as mammography, ultrasound, or biopsy, to determine the cause of the lumps.
Discuss your concerns with your healthcare provider and ask questions about the potential causes of the lumps and the next steps in your evaluation.
If you have not already done so, consider getting regular breast examinations and mammograms as recommended by your healthcare provider based on your age and risk factors for breast cancer.
If you have tuberous breasts, its essential to communicate this to your healthcare provider, as it may affect the evaluation and management of any breast lumps you may have.
Remember that most breast lumps are benign, and early detection and treatment can significantly improve outcomes for breast cancer if it turns out to be malignant.
Therefore, it is crucial to prioritize regular breast examinations and follow-up appointments with your healthcare provider, as recommended.
I hope this information will help you.

"Hi doctor,My mother is 60 years old and has been living with type 2 diabetes. Although there have not been any obvious indications that she is becoming worse as she ages, I am very concerned because she does not live the healthiest lifestyle in terms of her diet and weight. I make every effort I can to avoid bothering her and to stop her from getting angry frequently, which would cause her blood pressure to rise. Do you have any suggestions for how we should treat it? She has been consulting a doctor and does not use insulin but does take Dulaglutide for her appetite. Is there a plan I could assist her stick to, such as a particular diet or exercises she can perform at home? Is it possible to entirely eliminate type 2 diabetes? Please advise.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Thank you for your query.
I need more details about her diabetes. Please answer the questions that follow
1. For how long has she had diabetes?
2. What is the status of her diabetes normally?
3. What is her hemoglobin A1c glycated hemoglobin or the average sugar over the last two or three months?
4. Has she already experienced any diabetes-related complications, such as issues with her eyes, kidneys, heart, or feet?
5. Is she taking any other anti-diabetic medications? How are her blood pressure and lipids?
6. Have you done any recent blood tests?
If diabetes is not for a very long time and there are no complications, there are some patients who can reverse their diabetes with lifestyle modifications. However, if the condition has been present for a while and complications have developed, it is usually controlled with lifestyle modifications and drugs. Dulaglutide is a good drug, but mostly it needs to be given with some other drugs as well. It is not just to treat the sugar numbers, but most important is to prevent and treat diabetes complications. Treatment involves short-term and long-term goals, patient education, and motivation. There is no one diet to control or reverse diabetes. I suggest she takes a balanced diet with an emphasis on low carbohydrate portions and do physical activity. Simple walking can be beneficial if done routinely.
Please follow up for further assistance.

It will not do any harm if you swallow the pus. The pus will discharge at night while sleeping, and it is normal. It is not related to incomplete pus drainage.

I am a 29-year-old female who has been suffering from hypothyroidism. I did a complete profile blood test and had low urea 44.8 mgdL, and low creatinine 27.6023 gmL. What can I do to increase them? Please help. Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern. LFT liver function test and KFT kidney function test are normal. Serum creatinine and serum urea level are just below the lower value limit. The complete blood count is normal, with minor changes in a few values. Thyroid stimulating hormone, serum ferritin, and vitamin B12 values are normal. You take a Levothyroxine tablet for hypothyroidism to treat a normal TSH thyroid stimulating hormone. The relevance of serum creatinine levels below the normal range is appreciated far less in clinical practice than in higher values. I suggest not worrying about the laboratory values of serum creatinine and serum urea level. Low serum creatinine concentration causes are generally well known and include reduced muscle bulk, liver disease, significant fluid overload, and poor nutritional status. In your case, the reason might be reduced muscle bulkno need to take any supplements. Just take a balanced diet with more protein components in the food. I hope this information will help.

"Hello doctor,
A few days ago I jumped off a gate that was about 10 feet tall. Upon landing, I landed flat on my feet, a surge of excruciating pain took over my feet. Since then, I have trouble walking and the pain has not yet subsided. Though it hurts a lot when I am walking and putting pressure on my feet when I am in a resting position they do not hurt much. I was unable to walk the next day but a day after I was able to start walking. I am having semester and having a lot of work to do. I may have pushed my feet further and both of my feet of purple bruises on them around the arches of my feet as well as the inner heel. I went to see a doctor yesterday and he said that if I had a broken bone that I would be screaming every time I tried to walk or touch my feet. He said that I likely have muscle contusions and the pain is due to the immediate shock in foot muscles while landing. I have been trying to walk on the outer sides of my feet when I need but I am trying to stay grounded as much as possible. Is there any chance the doctor may have missed something? What should I do? My classes are starting shortly and I am worried that getting around is going to be a major challenge for me.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Without examining you it is very difficult to be precise but I can say with confidence that you have a significant injury  as bruising is a hallmark of either a fracture or a significant soft tissue trauma. Weight-bearing is the second thing we look at and if you cannot bear full weight with your foot flat and walk at least  five to seven steps, then again you need to be cautious. Thirdly, if you have pain at a localized area rather than over a large area then again  it is an indication for an x-ray. Looks like you need an x-ray. Not only will it rule out a fracture but also if you have no fracture but have the above symptoms then you need to look after yourself as some times the soft tissues take longer to heal than bony injuries. Also, sometimes you may need an MRI magnetic resonance imaging to be absolutely sure.

"Hi doctor,
My husband had AML nine years ago and was discharged in remission. He is now on a once-a-year review with the oncologist. Yesterday, he went for his checkup and discovered that the neutrophils have dropped. Below please find his readings
WBC 4.07, RBC 4.96, hemoglobin 15.0, platelets 188 and neutrophils 1.35. The reference range for neutrophils is at 1.56. He will need to go back in one months time for a retake of the blood test. He is so far doing fine with no fever, sore throat, ulcer apart from some backache. We are worried as there could be a relapse of leukemia. Can you assist to enlighten me? Thank you so much.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Your total WBC white blood cell count is within the limit and only neutrophils dropped down slightly. There are many causes for dropping in neutrophils count and infection like certain viral infections can sometimes lead to bone marrow suppression of neutrophils series.
If it is a relapsing case of leukemia then peripheral smear might show abnormal premature cells in excessive amount.
But anyway, as suggested by your oncologist, now you have to just repeat your CBC complete blood count with peripheral smear examination in few days and then we will discuss further.
Meanwhile, take a healthy diet and fruits.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

When did the burning during urination start?- Are you experiencing any abdominal pain or a history of recurrent fevers? Have you been evaluated for prostate size recently?- Do you feel a sense of incompleteness after emptying your bladder?In males, the urethra is shaped like an S, and some urine can get trapped.

Recurrent urinary tract infection UTI.2. Urethral stricture.3. Urethral diverticulum.4. Benign prostatic hyperplasia BPH.BPH typically occurs after the age of 50, which does not seem to be the case for you as you have been experiencing these symptoms for the last 20 years.Recurrent UTI is a possibility, which can be ruled out by cumulative urinary excretion CUE analysis.To investigate strictures and diverticulum, catheterization or radiographic evaluation of the urethra with contrast, such as retrograde cystourethrogram and ultrasound, may be required.I would advise you to avoid dairy products.Please provide further information or consult a healthcare professional for a detailed evaluation and appropriate management.
Welcome to icliniq.com.I have some more queries about your complaints.
Do you have any nocturia that is do you have any disturbed sleep due to increased frequency of urination during nights?
Any difficulty in passing urine or any hesitancy to start or any straining during urination?
Do you have any dribbling of urine at the end of urination or is the volume of urination increased?
How is the stream, normal flow or thin? When did the burning micturition start?
Do you have any abdominal pain and history of recurrent fevers? Have you ever been evaluated for prostate size in the recent past?
Do you feel incomplete after emptying of the bladder?
As male urethra is S shaped some urine gets trapped and milking often clears the trapped urine at the end of urination.
The complaints you have quoted may fit into one of the below.
Recurrent UTI urinary tract infection.
Urethral stricture.
Urethral diverticulum.
Benign prostatic hyperplasia BPH.
BPH usually occurs after 50 years, which is not in your case as you are having these for the last 20  years.
Recurrent UTI is a consideration which can be ruled out by CUE cumulative urinary excretion.
For strictures and diverticulum you need catheterization to rule out or radiographic evaluation of urethra with contrast like retrograde cystourethrogram and ultrasound.

There is no real pain, but recently I have noticed when I push on the area between my ribs below my sternum it feels tender. I am on two medications, Buspirone and Montelukast. Is my liver fine? I have cut way back from drinking and never consume more than three to five glasses a week. I am really anxious about it. Kindly suggest.
Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Occasional alcohol consumption, like one or two pints in a week, is considered to be fine. It depends on how your liver responds to alcohol. Some people show signs of acute liver damage in a short span of alcohol consumption. Some people may not show any signs of liver damage even with chronic and heavy consumption of alcohol. So it depends on how well your liver tolerates alcohol. The only way to be sure whether your liver is affected or not by the alcohol is to get liver function tests done. If they are within normal limits then it is fine. Chronic alcohol consumption gives rise to epigastric pain as in your case. It could be because of gastritis due to alcohol consumption. I suggest you take the tablet Pantoprazole Calcium Stearate and Hypromellose 40 mg once daily for 15 days in the morning on an empty stomach. You may have to continue for another 15 days if enough relief is not achieved. If symptoms continue, my suggestion is to visit your doctor immediately to find out other causes of epigastric pain.

"Hello doctor, I am having cervical fusion 3 levels 517. I am on 8 mg of Suboxone daily. I told the surgeon that I do not want opioids. Can I stay on 8 mg up to the surgery morning? I do not want to stop and have withdrawals or take any opioids before or after the procedure.","Hi.,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Suboxone Buprenorphine is given to treat opioid dependence. Prozac is an antidepressant. I think because of your disease process, cervical radiculopathy in your case, you have been taking some pain killers mostly opioids for a long time. Doctor might have prescribed Suboxone to take you off opioid dependence. Suboxone can cause a certain amount of drowsiness and has potential to interact with many drugs to cause side effects some of which may be significant. The decision on continuing Suboxone and Prozac until the day of surgery should be taken in discussion with your surgeon and anesthesiologist. It also depends on what anesthesia they are going to use during surgery.
It also depends on ur respiratory system, how well it is functioning. Your fear is that if put on opioid again post surgery, you may get addicted again. Be assured that as long as you are under medical supervision and adhere to instructions addiction potential will be less. As far as my knowledge goes they will definitely consider stopping Suboxone before surgery. Because if this is continued further analgesics prescribed post surgery may not work.
Do not be scared.

It is probably a sprain of ligaments. A break or fracture is less common from your description. Also, the fracture would have caused severe pain even at rest and not just on using the foot.

Yes, you are protected. Although the booster is not taken, some amount of immunity is provided by vaccination, it is enough to protect. So, it will protect you.

"Hello doctor,
I am 25 years old, and I have been engaging in masturbation for the past five years. I genuinely want to quit, but I am finding it challenging. Please help.
Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern.
Masturbation is a normal practice, and the majority of males, around ninety-five percent, engage in it as a way of experiencing sexual pleasure without a partner. It has various benefits
Stress relief.
Mood enhancement.
Improved sleep.
Prevention of depression and anxiety.
Relaxation of the mind.
Relief from pain and muscle cramps.
Release of sexual tension.
Boost in confidence.
Enhancement of sexual experiences.
Understanding personal needs and desires.
In females, it increases vaginal blood flow.
Masturbation itself does not harm your penis, and doing it two to three times a week is generally not an issue. However, exceeding this frequency may lead to tiredness, loss of concentration, and a sense of infertility.
If you are looking to reduce masturbation, I would suggest you consider the following
Sex education.
Physical exercises.
Adjusting sleep patterns and ensuring quality sleep.
Maintaining a healthy and balanced diet.
Engaging in leisure activities.
Developing spirituality.
Taking cold baths.
If you are experiencing tiredness or a decrease in strength, I suggest you capsule  Astymin Forte amino acids and multi-vitamin once in the morning and tablet Shelcal calcium and vitamin D3 once at night after food, for thirty days.

"Hello doctor.
I have a scalp infection and also had it in the past. I also have hair loss, dandruff, and severe itching.
Kindly help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I read your query and can understand your concern.
Dandruff, also known as seborrheic capitis, can cause intense itching as well as greasy to dry flakes on the scalp. Excessive perspiration, hereditary vulnerability, greasy skin, hormonal changes, constant usage of helmets and caps, and decreased immunity are the most prevalent causes of dandruff. It is important to keep any caps or helmets clean, well washed and disinfected, and sun-exposed from time to time, to avoid the formation of fungal components, which can lead to fungal infection on the scalp.
I suggest you to follow these steps
1. Use anti-dandruff shampoo
Mix three to four drops of the shampoo in 13 cup of water the cup which is used for bathing. The lather formed is to be applied on the scalp and massaged for one minute, keep it for 5 minutes, and wash it off. Use once every three days for the next six to eight months and in cases of future recurrences.
2. Capsule Itraconazole 200 mg antifungal Consume one capsule after dinner for 2 weeks. This is an antifungal which helps in reducing the fungal elements which in turn helps in reducing the itching and other symptoms as well
3. Tablet. Levocet M antihistamine Consume this tablet daily for two hours before going to sleep at night for 1 week. This helps in reducing itching
4. Make sure to avoid stagnation of sweat and moisture on the scalp and make sure to wipe off any excess sweat whenever they do appear. Make sure to clean the inside of the helmets and wash caps if they are being used and expose them in the sun from time to time.
Dandruff tends to be recurrent and can come back in case of any hormonal fluctuations or excess sweating during climatic changes. Therefore, these medications can be used during future recurrences as well.","{'score': 80, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 5, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"

Welcome to icliniq.com.
There are a few things of concern in your case. As your age is 42 years, the fertility reserve and quality of eggs usually reduce with age. So it becomes more and more difficult to conceive. As per your reports, the FSH is a little high, which could be due to perimenopausal transition. The irregularities in your periods are also because of the same reason. Your AMH anti-mullerian hormone level which is an indicator of the fertility reserve is very low that is 0.1 which means that there are almost a very few viable almost nil eggs remaining in the ovary.  You should consult a fertility expert and take an opinion regarding the possibility of IVF in-vitro fertilization, test-tube baby in other words after a thorough investigation of you and your husband and if possible should get it done at the earliest. Conceiving naturally is almost impossible in your case.

I want your opinion on who is the best person or where to start for diagnosing and treating ADD in a 12-year-old child. The information and opinions are mind-numbing and confusing. I have the choice of taking my daughter to a pediatrician or a psychiatrist, after having her tested by a psychologist for school performance related issues.

She is currently taking 20 mg Ritalin LA, and we need to re-evaluate the medication. In your professional opinion, where should one start?

Welcome to icliniq.com.
You have asked a very pertinent question. I am not sure about the medical system in your area. Usually, young children in primary school are seen by pediatricians. Once they move to secondary school and if they have any co-morbid conditions like depression or anxiety, they are usually seen by child psychiatrists. But this arrangement is not universal, and there are huge variations. Both developmental pediatricians and child psychiatrists have the training and expertise to assess and manage ADD or ADHD attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. So if you are comfortable with your current pediatrician, discuss your concerns with him or her about your daughters anxiety. If appropriate, they can refer your daughter to a child psychiatrist. Perhaps your daughters response to Ritalin LA Methylphenidate and tolerability needs to be reviewed, and dose has to be titrated accordingly. If there are any emotional difficulties, she will benefit from pastoral support at school or some counseling. If emotional problems are severe, getting a child psychiatrist opinion may be sensible. Also, we have to remind ourselves that the management of ADD or ADHD is not medication alone. Your daughter will benefit from individualized support to help with her school performance. Her self-esteem should not be affected by ADD. Let her enjoy doing activities which can provide positive experiences. If she likes sports or drama or any other similar field, let her have regular time for pursuing her interests.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

Welcome to icliniq, and thank you for choosing us as your provider for health care.
I have gone through your history and understand your concerns.
In short, yes is the answer to your problem. Stress and lack of sleep, which can lead to fatigue and, thus, a lack of interest in sex, can both contribute to erection issues. Now, to suggest a remedy, I would say, reduce your stress and ensure proper sleep, but I also know it is easier said than done. Nevertheless, it is essential to give it a try. There are many exercises available that can help you reduce stress and lifestyle changes that can improve the quality and quantity of your sleep. To learn about these exercises and the proper way to do them, you should consult a local psychologist or psychiatrist. If they are not available nearby or there are other difficulties, you can avail the services of this platform. Lastly, there are a number of pharmacological options to treat your problem, but for that, you have to consult a psychiatrist. They can also help you reach a proper diagnosis through a detailed evaluation and then initiate treatment. If you are not facing any other symptoms such as suicidal ideation or other serious ones, you should consider this option as a last resort

Welcome to icliniq.com. Thanks for posting your query. You might be having either a throat Infection or chest infection and may require antibiotics for this. In my opinion, instead of waiting for the cough to subside on its own and then consulting the doctor, it is better you consult him now. For symptomatic relief, you can do salt water gargling three to four times daily, drink hot water, avoid cold drinks, and ice cream, avoid citrus fruits, and avoid very oily food and nonvegetarian food.

"Hi doctor,
Two days ago, I met a sex worker and we were just kissing each other and my underwear was on. Then she started playing with herself and there were vaginal fluids on her hand. She put her hand on my face and close to my nose and wanted me to smell her vaginal fluid. After about 10 minutes, I felt like this thing might be dangerous, so I went and washed my face. I do not know if she had HIV Human Immunodeficiency virus or not but I am very scared.","Hello, Welcome to icliniq.com.
When there is no sex intervention and vaginal fluid was touched by her on the face, so it is clearly no penetration as the skin acts as a strong barrier. Kissing has the least chance or nil for HIV but yes, HSV herpes simplex virus is common. If any symptoms other than seasonal like a sore throat, common cold, then consult a general physician MD or an ENT specialist. The night sweat, rash all are common, so do not panic. Yet, if you have fear or anxiety, you can go for the test. Once the test results are negative, you are risk-free. Take healthy food, fruit juice, milk products. The test to be taken are ELISA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit within 7 to 10 days, RNA Ribonucleic acid PCR Polymerase Chain reaction on the 15th day, fourth generation CMIA Chemiluminescence Microparticle Immunoassay kit test on the 28th day.

From the short history, I feel this is a vaginal infection. You should have got it from that act of sex a few days ago. As a prevention, I would advise you not to have penetrative sex until the end of pregnancy. Infection from sex can also trigger a bleeding and early labor pains. For this infection, you can have antibiotics like tablet Azilide Azithromycin 500 mg once a day before food for three days and tablet Taxim-O Cefixime 200 mg twice a day for five days. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent. Also, keep vaginal suppositories capsule Clingen-Forte Clindamycin, Clotrimazole and Tinidazole or Candid-CL or Cansoft CL once at night for a week. You can have a local wash with V Wash or Intiwash twice a day for a week. Better treat it fast to prevent a trigger of pain or bleeding.

"Hi doctor,
I have had spots on my eyes for four years. First, they were less, but now they are spreading and getting darker.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern. I looked over the image attachment removed to protect the patients identity. As per the history and image provided, it is xanthelasma. Xanthelasma on eyelids is raised patchy lesions with yellow discoloration, which are harmless and usually a sign of cholesterol or diabetes, or both. Although they are harmless, being a sign of an underlying lifestyle condition, I would suggest you take a fasting lipid profile test for cholesterol and check for fasting blood sugar FBS, post-prandial blood sugar PPBS, and HbA1c Glycosylated hemoglobin test for diabetes. In case of fluctuations in the above from normal parameters. Consult a physician for starting medications. As for the xanthelasma lesions, although no medications for topical application are available, there are other modalities of treatment for cosmetic purposes, which includes erbium Laser therapy for removal of the lesion, diode laser therapy for lightly burning the lesion in layers, and radiofrequency cauterization where the laser is not involved, but the same procedure gently burns the lesions. All of these tasks are performed by a dermatologist. A surgeon can also remove the lesion surgically. All the procedures are harmless, quick, and painless as they are done under local or topical anesthesia in the form of numbing cream application before the procedures are done. They have no side effects. Kindly consult a doctor in person for the procedures. However, if the underlying cholesterol or diabetes is not controlled, there are high chance of the xanthelasma lesions recurring.","{'score': 62, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 2, 'transparency': 7}","{'score': 65, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 5, 'transparency': 7}","{'score': 55, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 5}"
"Hello doctor,My serum creatinine level has risen from 1mgdL to 1.4 mgdL over the past three months. I experience sharp, radiating pain from the left side of the navel down to my pelvic area once in a month. This pain subsides when I change positions and drink plenty of water. I have a history of diabetes and hypertension, for which I am under insulin and taking medications such as Novomix, Sitagliptin-Metformin, Byscard, Renovate, and Rivotril.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Your creatinine level of 1.4 mgdL is slightly elevated, as the usual serum creatinine level is below 1mgdL. This mild increase in creatinine could indicate significant renal involvement. It is essential to investigate your estimated glomerular filtration rate eGFR from a nearby laboratory for further assessment. Given your history of diabetes and hypertension, there is a possibility of kidney involvement, known as nephropathy. Depending on the results and clinical evaluation, a renal biopsy may be necessary for further histopathological examination. I recommend you consult a urologist for a thorough examination.

However, recently a friend offered to let me try on her very light prescription glasses, which made my vision clear.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
A 2020 vision does not rule out a refractive error. A lot of people have small numbers or latent hyperopia. This usually can be made to manifest by cycloplegic refraction or by fogging. Small errors may need to be corrected if you use computers for a longer time. Also, similar asthenopic symptoms occur due to computer vision syndrome. So, try doing the frequent blinking while working on laptops and other screens. Look into the distance every half an hour to relax your eye muscles. Use lubricating drops to keep your eyes moist. Use anti-glare glasses if using too bright lights. I hope this helps.

"Hello doctor,
My husband and I recently underwent an IVF cycle and it failed.
Originally, my husband has a problem with 1 morphology. But, now I a have poor ovarian reserve. I am 39 years old and my AMH was .24. However, my FSH was 5.5 last time. AMH was not repeated.
I was stimulated with the maximum dosages and only produced three eggs which all produced embryos I do not know the quality, only that one had progressed normally by day 3. We did a day 3 transfer. On the second day after the transfer, I had what I can only describe as scab-like discharge about the size of a tear. One the sixth day, I finally left the house and started to resume so level of normal activity no heavy lifting and that afternoon I had a very bright red urine flow like a small amount of blood pass when I used the bathroom. I thought that it might have been implantation bleeding, but clearly not.   I want to try IVF again, but I am afraid of the same results. In doing research, I found a book that suggests many environmental factors such as BPA and phthalates can play a part in egg quality, quantity and affect the sperm as well. The book suggests waiting three to four months prior to beginning IVF to get the full effect of supplements recommended as well as let the harmful chemicals leave your body.
My questions are given my numbers, in your opinion, will my number of eggs change drastically while waiting or should I be normal? Should I retest my AMH before making this decision? Also, is there any way for me to preserve my eggs not menstruate until the month before the IVF procedure. My thought was to take birth control pills for three months and not take the sugar pills. Is this safe? Can it be done? What are the repercussion?
Finally, Based on our numbers, would you recommend that we use donor eggs instead of trying another cycle?  This time around will have to be the last as we do not have any money after this one. It is critical that we make the right decision.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Looking at your case history, attachment removed to protect patient identity it would better to go for donor eggs. Ovarian reserve decreases with age and retesting for AMH anti-mullerian is not going to affect the outcome increase ovarian reserve, so no point in retesting AMH. By taking OC oral contraceptive pills continuously, you cannot halt a decrease in ovarian reserve loss of eggs.
Menses is just an indicator of loss, actually a woman loses 400-600 eggs per month irrespective of whether she gets menses or not. What you see on ultrasound is just loss of dominant follicle, the loss of those 600 follicles cannot be seen, it can be perceived indirectly by decrease in AMH, increased requirements of hormone injections during IVF in vitro fertilization, reduced number of eggs retrieved and low pregnancy rate.
One more effect of advanced age would be increased risk of Downs syndrome in the baby if you try with your own eggs. So considering your advanced age, low AMH, poor response to stimulation, low number of embryos formed in the last cycle and increased risk of Downs syndrome with own eggs I would suggest to go for donor eggs.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

Welcome to icliniq.com.
NT scan is just a screening test to pick-up cases of Trisomy. Nuchal translucency of less than 3.2 mm, nasal bone seen and normal blood flow in ductus means the chance of trisomy is very low. To confirm this doctor has done a double marker test. They too are within normal limits. These values are extrapolated over a graph of general values, as MOM- multiples of median. Both the markers are normal. In your case, only risk factors which have given a risk of 1 81, is your age any ratio  1250 has to be further investigated, which unfortunately cannot be altered. When the values are graphed over your age, they fall at high risk. But do not worry. So the ideal next step is to undergo an amniocentesis at 14-16 weeks of pregnancy and genetic analysis can give you a diagnostic result. I feel it will be normal. Just relax and wait for that normal result. You can definitely continue the pregnancy.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I passed carefully through your question and would explain that your symptoms could be related to an inner ear disorder peripheral vertigo or low blood pressure. Have you checked your blood pressure values during these episodes? If your blood pressure values are normal, I would recommend consulting with an ENT ear, nose, and throat specialist for a physical examination and performing labyrinthine tests. It is also necessary to check thyroid hormone levels. In the meantime, I would recommend taking magnesium supplements to help improve your situation.

"Hi doctor,
What dental service do I need when I have four extracted upper teeth and three extracted lower teeth? And I want to fill them permanently. Currently, I a using a marvel for long time and they do not fit anymore. Please help. Thanks.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I hope you are doing good. The extracted teeth have to be replaced. No need to replace wisdom teeth. But the replacement has to be done after complete healing of the wound. The replacement can be a removable partial denture or a fixed partial denture. It can be a flexible, removable partial denture, or in fixed dentures, it can be implanted. It depends on the bone density and requirements. If your current dentures do not fit well, you can check for correction and try it. Even after certain trimming of the denture, if it still does not fit, you can change to a new one. I suggest you take an intraoral clinical picture and consult me for further details.

Your pain seems to be related to H. pylori gastritis. Considering your gallbladder issues, it has sludge, small calculus, and poly of size 0.19 inches.

"Hello doctor,
I am a 41-year-old woman having a 15-year-old son. I have heavy periods and iron deficiency anemia. I was given an appointment for a salpingectomy next week and my coil got removed. The scan showed a six-centimeter fibroid in the muscle. I am also having pressure in the bladder and a frequent tendency to urinate. I cannot take any hormone-based treatment due to other health conditions. So I think surgery will be the only option. Is it unnecessary to have this operation next week? Or it would be better to have a subtotal hysterectomy by leaving my ovaries and cervix in place? I consulted my specialist and she still recommends salpingectomy. I cannot understand why? I am taking Lithium and Carbamazepine medications for bipolar disorder for the past 15 years. This is the reason I do not take any mood-altering or hormone-based medications. I am taking iron tablets daily for the past three years.
Kindly help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I went through your query and understood your concern.
It would be better if you send the scans and blood reports that have been done recently. For a woman of your age with multiple reasons for hysterectomy, it is better to have the ovaries and tubes to be removed as the ovaries have risks of cancer in the future. So in the case of hysterectomy and oophorectomy, you will need hormonal therapy to prevent menopausal side effects after the removal of ovaries. Menopausal symptoms include bone pain, hot flashes, loss of libido, and all the symptoms of post-menopausal life would be observed. But as said you cannot take hormonal medications due to other health issues. With many medical conditions surgery is difficult and mostly anesthesia department does not give permission for long surgery or longer unconsciousness. This is the reason you can have a subtotal hysterectomy with ring removal as this could be a less prolonged surgery when compared to total abdominal hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy.
I hope this has helped you.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Thanks for your query. I understand your concern. I have a few questions to help come to a diagnosis. How many days since this occurred? Was it sudden or developed over some time, like a couple of days? Is there any sticky yellow discharge? Is there any sensation of a foreign body in the eye? Is there any intolerance to light or inability to open the eye? Is it very painful or just irritating? Is there any swelling in front of the ear on touching swollen lymph node?

On looking at the photo attached attachment removed to protect patient identity, it could either be viral conjunctivitis, a scratch on the cornea abrasion, or something embedded in the eye. The treatment will depend on your answers to the above questions. Please reply to the message. An antibiotic eye drop like Moxifloxacin eye drops and an anti-inflammatory eye drop like Ketorolac will help subside the symptoms if it is an infection. But viral conjunctivitis will take time to reduce. A foreign body embedded will require an ophthalmologist to remove it. A scratch on the cornea will require either lubricating eye drops or an eye patch for 24 hours.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 91, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Pregnancy at the age of 48 years definitely come with certain risks like an increased risk of chromosomal abnormalities due to the defective ovum being released. Also there may be a difficulty in the conception itself. VBAC vaginal birth after cesarean delivery has to take into a lot of factors into consideration like the cause for previous LSCS lower segment cesarean section, the gestational age at which you had cesarean, the present baby weight, and if there is a spontaneous onset of labor or not and many other factors. I would suggest you go for an opinion from your gynaecologist before planning for a conception and take a pre-conceptional counselling so as to avoid any complications possible during pregnancy.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,
I am 29 years old. No prior heart issues. A fan of exercise. At the beginning of this year, I started having chest pain located near or right over my right side. Mostly they are a short quick burst of pain at random intervals but sometimes they stick around. A couple of weeks after the pain started, I had my first ever panic attack. Though I was having a heart attack, in the ER I had an ECG, chest X-ray and blood work. The tests showed nothing. The chest pain went away for a couple months. They then came back with worse during last month and I am still dealing with them. Since then I have met with a cardiologist. They performed a treadmill stress test results normal and I am currently wearing an event monitor for a month. I am having trouble accepting this might be anxiety causing the pains. I am worried it might be angina. The pain did not hurt earlier while working out but now it hurts. I do not know if that is because I am focusing on them and worrying about them. I guess what I am looking for is reassurance that the test I have done along with my history means that my heart is fine.","Hello,

Historically, and also on investigations like TMT treadmill test, it does not appear to be a cardiac pain attachment removed to protect patient identity. I guess you do not smoke or drink. The usual cause for this is musculoskeletal pain arising from muscles and bones which may increase during exercise due to rapid and heavy breathing.

"Hi doctor,
I am struggling with my health for almost 11 months. I started to have this issue two years back. I waked up one day with a headache accompanied by nausea, fatigue, shaking hands, blurry eyes, confusion, and loss of balance. I thought that I am going to die. I went to a doctor and he told me that my body remains pale. He assumed that I have anemia. He gave me pills and wrote a list of foods and supplements to eat. His medications helped me and I returned back to normal. After a year, my gums start to bleed. I started to have some gaps formed between my teeth with gum ache. I consulted a dentist. He referred me to a periodontist who diagnosed me with gum disease and underwent surgery. I took medications and ate soft food for two months. My surgery was successful but antibiotics affected my bowel badly. I had a runny stomach and then, it turned to constipation later. Blood came out while passing stools and I started to have tearing of anus several times while passing stools. My anus became itchy as if I had pinworms. I consulted a gastroenterologist and he diagnosed me with pruritis ani. He prescribed me a cream and it worked for two weeks. After that, things started to become abnormal until today. I am still experiencing irritation. I wake up every day with a feeling of going to die. Before a year, my symptoms resurfaced more intensely. I had a bad headache with nausea, fatigue, dizziness, shaking hands, memory loss, confusion, and blurry eyes. But this time, it remains worse. Sometimes, I have a feeling that I am going to have a loss of eyesight soon. I will sleep for eight hours and I will wake up in the morning with a feeling of having inability to blink my eyes. It happens every day. Even at night, I start to have headaches when I open my eyes. I consulted a physician and he did some tests. Everything came back normal. He told me to do another blood test and CT brain. I did my blood tests and it came back normal. I planned to do a CT brain after few days. My symptoms got worse day by day and so I went to a hospital for doing CT brain. Then they told me to come back after a month to have my results. After that, I was unable to go to hospital due to lockdown. Then I called the hospital to have my results. They told me to wait for a month. My symptoms was getting bad. So I pleaded with them and they told me to come to hospital. After going to the hospital, I came to know that my results were lost. The symptoms were resurfacing. My headache got less intense. But still, I have shaken hands, minor fatigue, and nausea daily. After a month, my headache returned back. My nausea became worse and my head was heavy. I seem to be physically tired and I have to act like nothing is wrong with me and I will do chores in my home. I did not receive any support from my family in this situation. My mum took my situation lightly. At this point, I do not have any idea about my body. I do not know whether it occurs due to chronic anxiety or depression or migraine or stress. After a month, all my symptoms have returned back to normal and now, I hate to go to hospital as nothing was found previously. Currently, it is hard to go to the hospital as it is full of covid patients. I am scared and lost hope in everything. Kindly suggest any medication. People living around me are self-centered, manipulative, toxic, and have zero empathy. I got sexually harassed by my stepdad four years back. He went out of my home three years back and my mom wants me to forgive him. Till, this day, I did not do it. My mum does not take care of me and she plays victim all the time. She has a blind eye on my situation and when I say to her, she tries to manifest things. She tells me to do prayers often. My stepbrother and other siblings are on my stepdads medical aid and even for small things, they go to a hospital immediately. When I mention my mental instability and depression to my mother, she changes the topic quickly and says me to avoid thinking about it. Recently, my aunt called my mother and asked her about my health. She told me that I am fine. My mum never sees me as a human being. Kindly help me.","Hi,

Probably you have a subclinical otitis externa. In this condition there will be a very subtle infection in the ear canal which leads to an intense amount of itching.

3. Wax dissolvent ear drops 3 drops three times a day for the next five days.
4. Keep the ear dry, please wear a shower cap while bathing.

Usually, oral sores or abscesses have a fluid accumulation. The fluid may be blood or a collection of any other fluids. So, you need not worry. Once the fluid comes out, the sore starts to subside. Kindly attach an intraoral picture to check for the presence of any dental caries, as dental caries also leads to abscess formation. It will take ten days on average for the sore to subside completely. No medications are needed. Kindly take a proper diet, drink more water, consume curd, avoid getting stressed, apply coconut oil, warm water, salt rinse, and use mouth wash.
Kindly follow up with a clinical picture to check for dental caries as the treatment for an abscess with dental caries is different.
Take care","{'score': 85, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 5, 'transparency': 8}","{'score': 84, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 7, 'transparency': 8}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,I have been diagnosed with Sacroiliitis caused by AS and hypermobility, which I manage without tablets, and by doing exercises, stretching, and seeing an osteopath once a month to prevent flare-ups. I have also been refered to a rheumatologist with suspected fibromyalgia and I am still waiting for the first appointment. I have now found out that I am six weeks pregnant and have a few questions. Can I still see the rheumatologist regarding fibromyalgia and treatment for sacroiliitis? How will pregnancy affect my sacroiliitis? Will I get more pain? Are there risks in giving birth? How could I be affected after giving birth?","Hello,Welcome to icliniq.com.To answer your questions in turn, yes, that will be fine to see a rheumatologist, they should be able to help you. It is hard to say how pregnancy will affect sacroiliitis. Some people improve during pregnancy and some people worsen but there are things that can be done even whilst you are pregnant. The rheumatologist can help you with this. There are not any actual extra risks of giving birth, your joints are inflamed but not damaged. After birth your symptoms may worsen or improve, it is difficult to know at this stage, but again there is plenty that can be done to help. So it would be good to see your rheumatologist shortly after birth.I hope this helps.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 94, 'clinical_accuracy': 19, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}"

In addition, you can apply T-Bact ointment Mupirocin. If there is no relief, it is best to get the child evaluated physically by a pediatrician. If there is no fever, you can apply T-Bact ointment to the white pustules whenever the baby is off to sleep and use the syrup Allegra dose as per the childs weight twice a day for three days.

"Hello doctor,
Because of the lockdown, I have not been able to go for my monthly braces checkup since March. Since my orthodontist comes from another city, because of the strict lockdown measures there, he cannot come to his office in my town. I have just three rubber bands left on my teeth now, the rest snapped recently while I was brushing, and the remaining ones are also close to snapping. I do not know what to do when they all snap. Will not the wire just hang on my teeth then and be super uncomfortable? My teeth have all been pretty much aligned but I am worried they will relapse if I do not go for a checkup soon.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I can totally understand the current situation of yours and it is quite tough to manage my own clinic in other state. I am managing it any how these days but cannot continue  very long. Since you have a shortage of bands, that is a problem but as you know if you could find your local dentist he might have these bands and will surely  help you. Secondly, as you have mentioned that your teeth has been already in shape, it is a benefit. Bands might not be needed anymore just finish what you have. As the fixed braces are on, there is no chance of relapse. So nothing to worry as long as the braces and wire is attached. And if  you have braces for extra two to three months that is just fine and will not affect the tooth arrangement in any kind. In worst case scenario, if  the braces get detached or just hang, your local dentist can remove them very easily and everyone is well acquainted so neither that will be an issue for you. So  If you want my advice, finish off the bands you already have. Once they are used up no need to place further bands.  Wait until things get normal as braces will not affect, instead they help to retain the shape.  If the braces get loosen visit your local dentist and get it removed. Your local dentist will provide you a retainer that will help to prevent relapse.  So nothing to worry about. Brush using an orthodontic toothbrush or soft bristle. Brush twice a day gently. Use HiOra-K mouthwash, and Colagate visible white toothpaste. Avoid sticky or sweet food as much possible. I hope this helps.","{'score': 85, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 5, 'transparency': 8}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 80, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Abdominal tuberculosis requires antituberculosis drugs for sure, but if a stricture is present even after taking medications for three to four months, then surgery is recommended to relieve obstruction due to stricture. Presently, she is neither able to eat nor able to pass stool due to strictures. If her overall general condition permits, the small intestine is intact, then she should undergo feeding jejunostomy to provide nutrient directly into intestine bypassing the duodenal stricture. For rectal and anal canal stricture, which is responsible for constipation, she might require enterostomy for diversion of stool. Although, before considering surgery as a treatment option, she must be evaluated for non-surgical options to treat strictures, endoscopy-guided dilatation. Hope I answered your query.

"Hello doctor,
I was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma last year and underwent the first cycle of 12 sessions of Folfox up to six months. However, the nodes became active again, leading to the initiation of the second cycle of chemotherapy with Paclitaxel. While the first cycle did not entail any side effects, this time I am experiencing pustules, as evident in the uploaded photos.
Additionally, I am an insulin-dependent diabetic and taking medication for hypertension. Currently, I am on Tablet Clavum 625 mg twice daily after food for the past two days, along with Fusidin cream.
Kindly help.
Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I can understand your concern.
After reviewing the details and images provided  attachments removed to protect patient identity, I fully understand your concerns.
Experiencing side effects such as pustules, folliculitis, rashes, and skin redness during chemotherapy sessions is a common occurrence and can be effectively managed. Rest assured, I will assist you in finding appropriate medications to alleviate the rash discomfort. It is important to recognize that during chemotherapy cycles, these side effects may recur, but the medications Im prescribing can be continued as needed.
While Clavam 625 Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid, an oral antibiotic, may help reduce the pustules, I recommend switching to a different antibiotic specifically formulated for facial and scalp pustular lesions, which can also be used in the future if new rashes appear.
Here are my recommendations
Aha Glow Advanced Gel Face Wash Use twice daily, applying one pump to wet skin, massaging gently for 30 seconds, and then rinsing off.
Cleargel Gel Clindamycin Gel Apply twice daily to affected areas after using the face wash.
Capsule Microdox LBX Doxycycline 100 mg Take one capsule after breakfast and one after dinner for seven days.
Tab Pantop 40 Pantoprazole Take one tablet 30 minutes before breakfast and one 30 minutes before dinner for seven days to prevent acidity caused by the antibiotics. Consult your doctor and take the medication appropriately.
Avoid manually expressing the pustules. They will resolve with the medication over time.
Acne OC Moisturizer optional Use as a moisturizer for the entire face if it feels dry, 15 minutes after applying the medicated gel to pimples.
Selsun Shampoo Use for scalp wash. Mix three to four drops in one and a half cups of water, apply to the scalp, massage for one minute, leave for three minutes, then rinse. Use once every three weeks or as needed.
Staying adequately hydrated can also help prevent acne, folliculitis, and dry skin.
If you notice pus becoming extremely painful, changing color, or experiencing severe inflammation, seek medical attention promptly.
Do not worry, these side effects will diminish with time, and the prescribed medications will expedite the healing process.
Wishing you a speedy recovery, and I hope my recommendations provide you with relief.
I hope this helps.

"Hello doctor,
I am having sharp pain in my lower left abdomen during intercourse, in a position when I am on my hand and knees. This pain is a recent development and has not been a problem before. Also, I am not pregnant. And I am certain that I do not have an STI because my husband and I have never had sexual relations with anyone apart from ourselves. What could be the reason for this pain?
Please help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have read your query and can understand your concern.
Based on the information that you have provided, there are a few possible reasons for that and I suggest you to follow the instructions mentioned below,
Firstly, make sure that you have not missed your period, and undergo a serum beta hCG test human chorionic gonadotropin just to confirm that you are not pregnant. If the test comes positive, then I suggest you undergo an immediate transvaginal ultrasonography to rule out ectopic pregnancy, or repeat the serum beta hCG test after 48 hours. If the test shows less than a 60  increase in hCG levels which normally should double around every 48 hours, it is a sign of an ectopic pregnancy.
Besides ectopic pregnancy, this type of pain can be due to endometrioma, local inflammatory lesions, or inflammatory cysts. I suggest you undergo a transvaginal ultrasound scan to rule out such an inflammatory cyst, endometrioma, or any other mass. However, a transvaginal ultrasound scan may not detect endometrioma. The gold standard for diagnosis of endometrioma is a laparoscopy. If these investigations detect an endometrioma, then I suggest you take cyclic oral contraceptive pills for three to six months as it will reduce endometriosis pain and also provide contraception. I suggest you consult a specialist, talk with them, and take the medications with their consent.
For pain relief associated with intercourse, I suggest you take a tablet of Ponstan Mefenamic Acid 500 mg around half an hour before intercourse.
I hope this has helped you. Kindly follow up if you have more doubts.

It is not necessary that everyone experiences nausea and vomitings or early signs of pregnancy similarly, some may not feel any symptoms, or some have mild symptoms. The urine hCG human chorionic gonadotropin tests are definitely an accurate way for testing pregnancy, rather than just relying on symptoms and they cannot be wrong as you had missed your periods too, and it tested positive twice. And if you are pregnant, you would not be even getting your periods again this April too.

Around 15 years ago, I had Redux for three months. Some 10 years back, I had an echocardiogram. The finding was very mild mitral valve regurgitation and everything else was good. Three years back when my brother had heart bypass, my doctor advised me to undergo some heart tests. I had them and they were fine. Even last year, my echo and stress were fine. I went in today for my yearly follow up and the doctor said that he wants to do a follow up echocardiogram. Because, some value on my last year echo was 58 and it is not supposed to be over 25. He said few reasons, but I did not really understand. Then he said something about checking for pulmonary hypertension. I read about that on the internet as it is a fatal disease, I am frantic now. When I asked the nurse, she said his notes say that I have no symptoms and no other indications too. I have attached all my echo reports. Could Redux be the reason for pulmonary hypertension? The nurse said that my last year echo was normal except for  the 58 value. Please clear my doubt.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Dexfenfluramine - Redux was banned because of causing pulmonary artery hypertension. In earlier days, doctors thought that Redux would cause pulmonary artery hypertension during the course of treatment. But, later we have found a lot of patients who developed pulmonary artery hypertension later in life. The numbers you are talking about seem to be of pulmonary artery pressure and yes, it is high. However, the good news is that you are asymptomatic. As you do not have any symptoms, at this point of life you do not have to worry about the death. A lot many people have pulmonary artery hypertension which is diagnosed by chance in investigations. But, they live a normal life if they are asymptomatic. Even if they have symptoms, we have a number of drugs that can be used to reduce the pulmonary hypertension like Sildenafil, Prostaglandin inhibitors.

"Hello doctor,
I am a 17-year-old male. My urine smells very strong and foul. This issue has been present for months, and I have been to the doctor regarding this.
If I had to describe the smell, I would say that it smells like a can of Vienna sausages, a terrible smell. After urinating, this smell will be from the toilet itself and will sometimes follow me for 20-30 seconds after leaving the room.
Currently, I am drinking around a gallon of water a day to ensure that it is not due to dehydration.
Previously, I have been to the doctor three times on this issue. They did a urine culture to test for UTI, blood tests presumably to test for STDshigh calcium levels. Everything came back negative.
I am also facing constant pain in the ribs and the back I have bad posture. While urinating, it feels like something is trying to escape my bladder with some pain. I feel dehydrated when I wake up. This is most likely from some issues with my nasal cavity, causing my nose to swap to my mouth. I have not had blood in my urine. I am urinating semi-frequently. However, I would assume it is due to the gallon of water a day.
I have tried all kinds of things to stop it, like taking vitamins, changing my diet, exercise, drinking more water, and other drinks like Gatorade. Please help.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I can understand your concern. According to your statement, you have been suffering from foul-smelling urination for months, feeling of pain during micturition, constant pain in the ribs, back pain, etc.
Foul-smelling urine with a feeling of some pain mostly indicates urinary tract infections UTI. But you have already done some investigations which exclude UTI. Other than UTI, dehydration, and diabetes may be the possible causes. Dehydration is excluded as you usually drink lots of water. So, such type of clinical features may result from diabetes as the body is trying to get rid of excess blood sugar and is disposing of glucose through your urine.
Your rib and back pain may result from muscle strains or sprains, acid reflux, and many other causes.
You can undergo some investigations like RBS random blood sugar to exclude DM, USG ultrasound of WA to exclude urethritis or prostatitis, serum creatinine to exclude any kidney problems, X-ray spine with KUB kidney, ureter, and bladder to exclude kidney stones, ECG electrocardiography and CXR chest x-ray to exclude chest and heart related any problems.
Your drug history, bowel movement history, and family history of arthritis are also important here for confirming any diagnosis.","{'score': 86, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 8}","{'score': 88, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 5, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hi doctor,
I was diagnosed with the somatic symptom disorder. While in anxious situations, it feels like paralysis or nervous breakdown might happen. Also, my hands become cold and my forehead becomes hot. Since the past 1 year, I am on Etizola Beta Etizolam 0.5 and Propranolol 20 on a total of five tablets a day in the pattern of 2-2-1. Now, this combination does not seem to be that effective and my doctor who has given me the following medications. Clonazepam 0.5 and Nexipride 50 mg in the night, Clonazepam 0.5, Ciplar LA 40 mg, and Bupropion XL 150 mg in the morning and a 0.5 mg Clonazepam in the afternoon. Is it safe to take this combination? The reason why I am asking is that Levosulpiride decreases the effect of D2 dopamine whereas Bupropion increases it by inhibiting the reuptake of dopamine. Is it dangerous to take this combination? Initially, my doctor wanted to recommend me Mirtazapine, but when he found out that my cholesterol levels are high, he switched to Bupropion XL 150 mg. Is it safe to take Bupropion and Levosulpiride together?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
There is no interaction between Bupropion and Nexipride Levosulpiride hence, no safety issue arises with this combination. Amisulpride is commonly added as an adjunct medication for synergistic effect. Instead, the point which should be taken into consideration is the amount and duration of intake of Benzodiazepine that is Etizolam previously. Presently, you are on Clonax Clonazepam and that too should be titrated accordingly. One more thing that I want to comment here is your weight. We should have a holistic approach and non-pharmacological methods are equally important to maintain weight.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,I have been married for the last one and a half years. My wife suffers from OCD. She does not want to hear any negative thing and especially if she negatively discusses sleep. Now she gets anxious when sleeping is discussed. This has occurred because of my telling lies to her about certain things. From that time onward, she has started behaving like this and has now been diagnosed by a doctor with OCD. The doctor gave her some medicines like Flunil for six months, which helped, but still the problem persists. Please help.Thank you.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have read your query, and I can understand your concern.
First of all, I would like to make it clear that telling lies does not cause OCD obsessive-compulsive disorder. Therefore, stop blaming yourself for it. It is possible that it was observed after the said incident, but it does not mean it was caused by discussing some lies with your wife. Secondly, I like to inform you that OCD is a treatable condition today. There are two principal modalities of treatment, including cognitive behavior therapy and medications. Since Flunil Fluoxetine helped her extensively, I feel she should be restarted with Flunil at 20 mg, which can be increased to 40 mg after one week and 60 mg after two weeks. Mostly the effects are seen within three to four weeks, and the complete response may take three months. If Flunil alone does not help completely, other medications can be added to get complete relief from her OCD. If there were side effects with Flunil, other options can be considered, such as Lexapro Escitalopram, Fluvoxin Fluvoxamine, and Paxil Paroxetine. The duration of treatment is often long and may last at least two years, so there is decreased chance of relapse in the future.
I hope this information will help you.

"Hello doctor,
I get small bumps on my forehead and have a lot of dark spots on my cheeks. My skin is very sensitive. I think I broke out from using a face brush or over exfoliating. My skin clears up so well in the summertime so what should I do during the colder weather?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com
Well on looking at the picture attachment removed to protect the patients identity there is a lot of acne on the forehead.
For treatment
Clindamycin Clintop, Faceclin, and Clear gel are preventive and curative. So I suggest you use it all over your face in the morning. Adapalene gel Adalene and Defferine use over the acne at night. Take a tablet of Doxycycline 100 mg once a day.
For dark spots
1. Avoid direct sunlight exposure as much as you can. Wear sunglasses, and caps, and cover exposed parts of the body all the time.
2. Use sunscreen thrice a day like 10 oclock, 12, and 3 oclock all over the face
3. Sunscreen SPF sun protection factor should be around 50.
4. Use anti-pigmentation creams like Kojic acid, Hydroquinone, Depiwhite cream, etc over the pigmented areas.
5. If tanning is deep and too much then the ideal treatment is Glycolic acid peels. Sittings of six to eight peels may be required.
6. Never stop using sunscreen even if tanning goes off.

"Hi doctor,
Is there any test to identify monkeypox? Kindly suggest me one if I have to undergo it. I went to a tropical country last week, and now I have developed fatigue, fever, headache, and pain in the armpit lymph node. How do I get to know if it is monkeypox? Also, do I need to isolate myself? Kindly give me your suggestions.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Thank you for consulting us on icliniq.com.
Monkeypox is diagnosed clinically with typical signs. The first stage is characterized by fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes, often in the neck and armpits, and tiredness. The second stage is characterized by a rash on any part of the body, and after one or three days, the fever begins. The lesions of the rash or the blisters develop on any part of the body, including genital areas. It can also spread to other parts of the body. The rash often goes through several stages before scarring and resolving.
This virus can be spread to others by an infected person until all the scabs fall off and a fresh layer of skin appears. The virus-infected patient should get isolated and also treated. It is diagnosed by performing,
Polymerase chain reaction PCR - The optimal diagnostic samples for monkeypox are from skin lesions, the roof or fluid from vesicles and pustules, and dry crusts. Where a feasible biopsy is an option, lesion samples must be stored in a dry, sterile tube, not a viral transport media, and should be kept cold.
The vaccines available are,
Food and Drug Administration FDA licensed vaccines available for preventing monkeypox infection are JYNNEOS smallpox and monkeypox vaccine, live, non-replicating, also known as Imvamune or Imvanex, and ACAM2000 smallpox vaccine, live.
According to the CDC Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, USA United States of America, there is a limited supply of JYNNEOS in the USA. On the other hand, there is an ample supply of ACAM2000 available. However, the latter vaccine should not be used in people with some health conditions, including a weakened immune system, skin conditions like atopic dermatitis, eczema, or pregnancy. In addition, no data are available yet on the effectiveness of these vaccines in the current outbreak.
People are considered fully vaccinated about two weeks after their second shot of JYNNEOS and four weeks after receiving ACAM2000.
So, I suggest you get PCR of skin samples done. I hope this has helped you.","{'score': 96, 'clinical_accuracy': 19, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 9, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 95, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 9, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Hand, foot, and mouth disease is a contagious but usually mild disease caused by the Coxsackie virus, affecting children and adults. The usual symptoms are sore throat, fever, and raised skin rashes on hands and feet. It usually is self-limiting and recovers within seven to ten days unless complicated. The best option is to maintain hydration, eat soft meals, and control fever. In your case, it appears from your description that your child does not have a fever or sore throat, and the rashes on the bums are mosquito bites. Hence, your child does not appear to have the disease, and please be on the watch for the appearance of symptoms such as fever, sore throat, etc. If the disease spreads in the school, get a fair idea from the school and I suggest avoiding school for a week.

"Hello doctor,
I am a 45-year-old male. My height is 55, and my weight is 165.34 Ibs. I have been passing black stool for several days. I consulted a doctor, and he did some blood investigations. It showed fluctuations in my serum aluminum and serum globulin values.
What should I do now?
Kindly help.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Thank you for the query. I can understand your concern. According to your statement, you have been suffering from the passing of black stool. I saw the reports that you have sent attachments removed to protect the patients identity.
Passing of black stool is not always a matter of serious concern. Black foods, iron supplements, and other medications like bismuth may cause black stool. The black stool which results from bleeding is known as melena. Bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract GIT may cause melena. So, melena may result from various underlying health conditions like peptic ulcers, gastritis, esophageal varices, diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel diseases like ulcerative colitis, hemorrhoids, constipation, etc. As your hemoglobin level is below normal, so there may be pathological conditions.
Treatment depends upon the cause. Some investigations like endoscopy of upper GIT, colonoscopy, occult blood test, CT computed tomography, or MRI magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen are needed to detect the underlying causes for your present sufferings.
Again, according to the blood report, your globulin level is above average, and that may result from infection, inflammatory conditions, immune diseases, lymphoma, carcinoma, etc. A low albumin and globulin ratio may indicate the overproduction of globulin, resulting from the causes mentioned above or loss of albumin due to kidney disease like nephrotic syndrome.
But, one blood report does not confirm anything. Blood test results may vary from laboratory to laboratory. So, repeat the albumin, globulin, albumin globulin ratio from two different laboratories concurrently one month later. If two blood reports show abnormal results, then do as needful.
Take care.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

1. Yes, it can be anal fissures. Also, you can look for a skin tag around perianal area, which occurs in anal fissure.
2. Does the child have constipation or tight stools? Because, if it is an anal fissure, then we will have to see the cause of hard stools as the difficulty to pass stool can cause fissures.

Can we give milk with honey? Please help.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Constipation is a common problem for children of this age. We should try to rule out any significant medical causes like anal stenosis and for this, you have to visit a pediatric surgeon. Dietary changes like avoiding milk products should be started as suggested by your doctor when no other cause is found. Give a fiber-rich diet, fresh fruits and plenty of liquids. You can try apple or pear juices as they are beneficial. Muout powder Polyethylene glycol is a good medicine. You should take one scoop of the powder in water twice daily for two weeks, and once the symptoms get better, then you can give the powder only in the night for three months. You have to use it for at least three months because only then the bowel habit gets regularized. It is a lengthy treatment, but please stick to it. Avoid high-calorie food like sugar, fries, etc. Your daughters weight is very less. Try to improve her diet as that will improve the general well-being as well. Milk can be given with honey.

I have had a sore throat for about three weeks now. Two weeks ago I have had strep throat and doctor gave me 10 dose antibiotics but my sore throat came back on my left side and it hurts my ear and throat when I swallow still. What could this be? They did a swab for the throat but no strep but what else is this? I have a minor cough.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
With the conversation I understand that you had suffered sore throat for which swab was done and appropriate antibiotic was initiated. Now again you have developed sore throat, more so on left side, with ear ache while swallowing. Most probably there is inflammation which has not fully got resolved. Since throat tests are negative, we can conclude that there is no active infection. But infectious products may be remaining causing the body to produce counter products inflammatory response. The same is causing you the troubles. Since the back of throat is connected to ear through the eustachian tube, it pains in the ear also. The local congestion has blocked the tube impairing normal ventilation and drainage of middle ear. I suggest you the following which if you take you will find relief. Anti-inflammatory tablets of Trypsin-Chymotrypsin and RutopsideBromelain combination, taken before food twice a day for 5 days. Also painkillers ParacetamolAcetaminophen appropriate dosage will do. To relieve ear ache and eustachian tube obstruction you may use nasal decongestant drops Xylometazoline. Take three drops in one nostril and lie down with head tilted towards that side ear 45 degres, the drops will percolate inside to the eustachian tube orifice and decongest the same. Repeat the same in other nostril and do this twice daily for 3 or 4 days. Follow it up with steam inhalation. Also use warm saline gargles few times daily as it soothes the area inflamed and help reduce edema and congestion. I would suggest you stop smoking if you do, avoid spicy foods and take plenty of hot fluids. If still after 5 days of these measures you do not find relief, it is advisable to consult an otolaryngologist. If you do not find improvement after this then we have to rule out reflux laryngitis, chronic sinusitis and few other conditions which may be triggering constant throat issue in you.","{'score': 89, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"

Kindly suggest.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
If youre experiencing extreme grab-and-release pain in your left rib and shoulder, along with bloody sputum, and your doctor has diagnosed you with pneumonia, it is important to follow their prescribed treatment plan. Pneumonia is a serious infection of the lungs that can cause symptoms such as chest pain, cough, difficulty breathing, and coughing up phlegm or sputum. The antibiotic, Amoxicillin-Clavulanate Augmentin, and the corticosteroid- Prednisone Prednisolone and Lactose, are commonly prescribed for the treatment of pneumonia. Antibiotics help target bacterial infections, while corticosteroids may help reduce inflammation and improve symptoms. Coughing up bloody sputum, known as hemoptysis, can be concerning and may indicate a more severe infection but since it was an old complaint now you should not be considered, as infection must be healing. In the meantime, you can take measures to support your recovery, such as getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and following your doctors instructions for taking your medications. It is important to complete the full course of antibiotics prescribed to ensure the infection is properly treated. If your symptoms worsen or if you have any concerns, it is crucial to reach out to your healthcare provider for further evaluation and guidance. Please consult with your doctor for personalized medical advice based on your specific situation. I hope you find this helpful.

"Hi doctor,
My son and I went for a jog. We used to run in our regular route but had not done it for about a week and a half. We would usually run to point A, stop for a few seconds, catch our breath, do a brisk walk, and run back home. However, when we reached point A, we stopped to catch our breathe, my son stated that he was feeling a bit nauseous. He usually sits on a railing when we reached that point. He was sitting when he said that. Shortly after saying he was nauseous, he said that he was feeling to faint. About five seconds after he collapsed on me. When I looked at him, he was delirious for a few seconds then his eyes rolled back in his head. He started gasping for air and had slight muscle convulsions. He seemed unable to breathe. It lasted about 20 to 30 seconds then he was completely out. He stopped moving and seemed like he was asleep. I kept calling him and lightly tapping his cheek to wake him. When he got up, he gasped again and called out to me. His eyes were still rolling back a bit, but he seemed more conscious than before. At this time, someone came to assist and helped me stretch out his legs. I kept telling him to take deep breaths, and when he looked conscious, he started crying and saying that he was in pain. When I asked where it was paining he pointed to his butt and hamstring. So I automatically thought it was a cramp and started rubbing the tendon by his ankle and calf. After a few seconds, he said it had eased a bit. He remained on the pavement for about 15 minutes before I asked him if he could get up. He still looked nauseous and stated that his leg was still hurting a lot but only when he tried to move.
My son is involved in football and swimming and is usually very active. However, due to the restrictions of COVID-19, he has been active when with me and inactive while with his grandparents. It is usually one week with me and one week with them. Over a few months, he also gained a little weight. Kindly advise.","Hello,

By your description, it does not seem like the child has any convulsion or seizure disorder. This kind of fainting happening in an 11-year-old, who is otherwise asymptomatic, never had such problems before, there are two things that we need to address immediately.
1. Hypoglycemia - low blood sugar level could lead to such symptoms. As you say, it had been about 10 days since he had any kind of physical exercise. This could be the transition period.
2. Hypotension i.e. low blood pressure. This can happen in a young and healthy child who was active previously but had ceased all exercises for a certain period and then went from rest-to-exertion in a short span. He probably should have taken it easy the first day of restarting.
These are the things that need to be checked first. The other causes can be electrolyte imbalances, thromboembolism, or even a cardiac issue.
So, in order to advise anything further, he will need his blood sugar, blood pressure, electrolytes checked, and an ECG to be done.
Further course of management will be based on the findings in these tests.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hi doctor,
My partner and I are having issues in our sex life due to our differences. I have more experience and am more open and experimental than him. It has been almost two years and while he has tried a few different things a handful of times, he is not comfortable experimenting or getting rough with me during sex no matter how much I beg. If I try to get rough or talk dirty he has performance issues. So I have had to make all the compromises in our sexual relationship. We do talk very openly about these issues and I have been very clear as to what I want from him and he has said he will try. However, when it comes time to try he is uncomfortable and unable to follow through. It is like he has a mental block. So I just shut down and play along to be sure he gets satisfied while I get left unfulfilled. I do not know what else to do to fix our problems. The rest of our relationship is perfect, it is just our sex life that is suffering. Any advice you could offer would be helpful.
Thank you.","Hi,
Thank you for stopping by
I am here to provide an expert opinion on your medical issues.
You can talk with him again while both of you are in a relaxed state and discuss the problems you are facing. If things persist even then, I suggest consulting a counselor. This should help to resolve the issue. Herbal supplements containing Yohimbine, L-arginine, etc. can be used for him to improve his sexual desire.
I hope this information will help you. Please revert in case of further queries.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
From your description and the given picture attachment removed to protect patient identity, it seems you have a mole or melanocytic nevus. They are considered benign melanomas and nothing actively needs to be done for them. If the mole shows a sudden increase in size, differential pigmentation, bleeding, irregular borders, etc., then you may go for a skin biopsy. If you want to get it removed for purely cosmetic reasons, then you may choose any of the following

The MRI attachment removed to protect patient identity does not show a residual or recurrent tumor as per what you have written as part of the MRI report. Hisone Hydrocortisone is a steroid supplement for hormonal imbalances, which may occur after pituitary surgery. The so-called residual tumor which you have interpreted may be postoperative changes that are common after pituitary surgery. If the four points that you have written are what was written on the report, then you should not worry. Meet your operating surgeon for further advice regarding Hisone, which may cause weight gain.

"Hello doctor,I have PCOS. I had my withdrawal bleeding from taking the tablet Meprate Medroxyprogesterone 10 mg for five days as prescribed by a doctor. On the 14th day of my cycle, I had unprotected sex with my boyfriend, but he pulled out before ejaculating. I also took an I-pill within three hours of intercourse.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
As you are on the 14th day of your cycle, the discharge indicates that it is your fertile period, so chances of pregnancy were high, keeping in view that even pre cum contains live sperms. However, as you have rightly taken an I-pill within three hours of sex, this should protect you from unplanned pregnancy. The success rate of an I-pill taken within 72 hrs of intercourse is 99.
Post the I-pill intake, you should expect a withdrawal bleed in the next three to seven days, indicating that you are pregnancy safe. If no bleeding happens until the next ten days, then take a blood serum beta hCG human chorionic gonadotropin test to rule out pregnancy.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,
I have been having pain during sex for two months. I went for a check-up, and the doctor found nothing wrong. Lubrication during sex is not a problem, but the penetration and sexual activity are painful, and after sex, it becomes hard to urinate and hurts. Please help me.
Thank you.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have read your query, and I can understand your concern.
There can be two possibilities for your situation.
1. Endometriosis - Blood during periods flows out of the cervix, but a small fraction flows through the tube into the abdomen and settles around the uterus and vagina. This causes blood clots and adhesions in the surrounding muscles and ligaments. When the penis enters the cervix during periods, there will be sharp stabbing pain. As the bladder and bowel are close to the uterus, this can cause pain while passing urine or stool, depending on which organ adhesions have formed. After some time, the pain gradually subsides. When a doctor examines, nothing is seen, as it is inside the abdomen. Methods to find it out are a deep examination by a doctor and ultrasound scans to identify the cause of pain. The examination reveals restricted organ movement and may show cysts. Laparoscopy may be needed if you are planning for a baby and are not successful.
2. Pelvic infection- Vaginal infection is transmitted during sex, so both partners have to be treated at the same time, or else you will get infected next time during sex. You may have white, yellow, or grayish discharge with or without itching, foul smell, or pain at the beginning of sex due to dryness as the lubrication will be reduced or excessive discharge present at a later stage towards the end. When a fully erect penis touches the innermost vagina  due to inflammation of the structures around the uterus pain radiates to the back or thighs. The infection affects bowel movement, and also features of gastritis occur. Bleeding during periods will be thicker, darker, and may smell bad. There will be more days with spotting after the periods. A throbbing pain is present even before periods and last after periods are over. Before treatment, confirm that you are not pregnant. I would suggest the following treatment for you and your partner, and they must be taken on the same day
1. Tablet Fluconazole 150 mg stat, only one tablet is taken after lunch, and there is no repetition.
2. Tablet Azithromycin 1 gm stat only one tablet is taken one hour before food, and there is no repetition.
3. Tablet Secnidazole forte stat, two tablets are taken after dinner, and there is no repetition.
4. Capsule Doxycycline 100 mg is taken twice a day for one week.
5. Vaginal wash with a gentle cleanser twice a day followed by vaginal pessary.
6. Capsule Clingen forte Clindamycin, Clotrimazole, and Tinidazole or Candid CL Clindamycin and Clotrimazole, or Cansoft CL Clindamycin and Clotrimazole once at night for five nights.
7. Your partner can locally apply antibiotic and antifungal creams like Candid B Beclomethasone and Clotrimazole, Candiderma Beclomethasone, Clotrimazole, and Neomycin, or Lobate GM Clobetasol, Miconazole, and Neomycin on the penis twice a day after washing for seven days.  Consult a specialist doctor and take medications with their consent.
Do not have sex till the infection has fully subsided. Immediately treat the infection as delay may send the infection inwards and may affect both of your future fertility.
I hope this information will help you.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
You can start by following some basic rules of eating healthy. Include raw foods like vegetable salads in the diet. Fruits can be taken in moderation once a day. Avoid fruits with a high glycemic index like grapes, mango and jackfruit. Eat three different types of grain a day and avoid mixing two types of grains in one meal. For example, you can have a wheat based recipe for breakfast, rice based for lunch and finger millet ragi based for dinner. Try to eat six to seven small meals instead of three big meals. To get a detailed diet plan,  please get back with a detailed blood report of the following tests. Do fasting blood sugar and postprandial blood sugar, HbA1C glycated hemoglobin and lipid profile, thyroid function test and renal function test RFT.

"Hi doctor,
I have ringworm on the thighs, arms and chest for four months. When I used Fourderm, it was fine for two weeks. But again, it came back. I have not taken any oral medicines yet. I am on  BP medicine Stamlo Beta. My age is 59 years.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com. Dermatophytosis or ringworm infection is caused by fungi that invade and grow in dead keratin. Tinea corporis is the fungal infection of the body, including the trunk and arms. Risk factors for recurrent fungal infections include any immunocompromised state like diabetes. Have you ever been tested for diabetes? Do you have intense itching? Do you have isolated or large confluence of lesions at the sites you have mentioned? Are there any extensive skin lesions? How is the response to topical therapy?
Apart from medical management, following preventive measures are to be followed good nail hygiene, good skin hygiene, and avoid dampness or wetting of the skin. Wear loose-fitting and clean undergarments as well as clothes. Coming to medical management, topical antifungals are effective for treating most cases of tinea corporis. Systemic therapy is given in immunocompromised individuals, extensive skin lesions, and those refractory to topical therapy. For you, as you are responsive to topical agents and your lesions are not extensive, I would advise you to take the following therapy. Topical therapy has to be applied to the lesion and at least 0.07 feet beyond this area twice daily for at least two weeks. Use Candid powder or Clotrimazole powder topically after a shower twice daily, or apply Monistat or Miconazole ointment or lotion sparingly to avoid maceration. Apply Luzu or Luliconazole 1 once daily after a shower for one week. If you have intense itching, take tablet Levocetirizine twice daily until the itching subsides. Do not scratch as this may lead to secondary bacterial infection. Revert back with the answers if yes to an internal medicine physician online.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

Welcome to icliniq.com.
From your query I understood your concern. Epigastric pain radiating to back and shoulders should be evaluated for gastric discomforts like gastritis and cholecystitis which is very common in deranged lipid profile. I believe this is due to hyperlipidemia.
Your lipid profile is out of proportion. You need to bring these values down. Also you need investigations and thorough assessment to rule out other hereditary causes of hyperlipidemia.
Below mentioned measures have to be followed to maintain the cholesterol within range,
You need workup for pancreas, gallbladder and amylase levels.
Get an abdominal ultrasound to rule out any gallstones.
It can be controlled by taking lipid lowering agents like statin analogues or resins to reduce cholesterol absorption.
Follow the diet and lifestyle modifications mentioned below.
Once ruled out, likely possibility would be gastritis which is easily manageable with some antacids and some proton pump inhibitors.
Management
A good and most important start would be to lose weight at least 33 lbs. Your current BMI body mass index is 27 which means your are obese, reduce it to less than 25. The key is healthy diet and lifestyle, regular exercise, weight balance, etc.
Choose healthier fat like omega 3, omega 6, mono and polyunsaturated fat olive oil, canola oil, almonds, walnuts, etc and say good bye to bad cholesterol like saturated fat. Planning diet with limited fat intake will also help. Make sure that you get no more than 300 mg of cholesterol a day.
Select grains with more fiber such as wheat, pasta, corn flour, etc. Prefer fresh fruits and vegetables. Avoid processed and canned products as well as fries. Eat heart friendly fish with less fat content like tuna, mackerel, salmon, halibut etc.
Avoid alcohol, if impossible keep the intake to minimum and never exceed moderation levels. Avoid smoking. Doing exercise regularly for 45 minutes a day and 250 minutes a week should be your main goal. Artichoke, garlic, oat bran, sitostanol stigmastanol, blond psyllium, margarines, etc., can help. Lipid lowering agents like statin analogues can be considered too. Talk to your doctor for physical examination and let them help you in this regard.","{'score': 91, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 9, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 96, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hi doctor,
My mother is 71-years-old. She weighs 147.71 Lbs, and her height is 5.41 feet approximately. Four months ago, she fell suddenly and became unconscious while trying to pluck flowers in the garden. As soon as she fell, her forehead got injured and bleeding with a cut above the eyebrow. Immediately I splashed water on her face to make her conscious, and after two minutes, her consciousness returned. Right after that, we admitted her to the hospital for her forehead injury, where they took MRI Magnetic Resonance Imaging and CTComputed Tomography scan and declared no issues with the brain. After two hours of admission, she reported chest pain due to the fall. So echocardiogram was taken. Based on the report, the treating doctors said there is a 70  probability of valve shrinkage but could not confirm that. Then they placed her under Holter monitor for 48 hours. A cardio CT and echocardiogram were retaken, and valve shrinkage was again diagnosed but not confirmed. The doctor suggested valve replacement surgery as the treatment. Her blood pressure on the day of the incident and the following five days was 180110 mm Hg. We had a second opinion regarding my mothers heart condition with another doctor. He also ordered an echocardiogram and said that valve shrinkage was present. He also put her under a Holter monitor for three days and suggested the same treatment. Thirdly, we consulted another doctor, who took an echocardiogram and said that while viewing from one side, valve shrinkage was present while it is not while considering from the other side. He also suggested a neurologists opinion, which is awaited. She also has a history of falls two to three times previously, but she was conscious and aware of her falls. She is taking medications for rheumatoid arthritis and has taken medication for nerve problems since 15 days before the fall. She has been taking drugs prescribed by her treating doctor since the incident. I have attached all the reports and prescriptions for your reference. We are ready to have valve replacement surgery, but could you please let us know the reason for her fall and subsequent loss of consciousness? Also, is the valve shrinkage present? If so, how much? Is valve replacement surgery the only option? Kindly help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I can understand your concern. I have gone through the reports attachment removed to protect the patients identity. There are two reports, one with severe aortic stenosis and the other with moderate aortic stenosis. Based on the first report of severe aortic stenosis and her loss of consciousness, the likely cause is aortic stenosis only valve shrinkage, and I suggest valve replacement for the same. And if we see other reports that mention moderate valve shrinkage, the aortic valve area mentioned is 1 cm, which is relatively low. And with this valve area, along with loss of consciousness episodes, it is better to subject her to valve replacement. Based on symptoms and standard neurological tests, severe aortic stenosis reports appear more accurate valve shrinkage than the report of moderate aortic stenosis. Your mothers symptoms are due to valve shrinkage, based on an abnormal echocardiography report and unremarkable other tests.

"Hello doctor,
I am an 18-year-old male. I have a lump on the inside of my groin. It is about the size of a 5 cent Australian piece, and I can feel it under my skin almost as if the skin moves over the top of it. So, I do not think it is a dermatological thing. I have little spots around my pubic area but I think that is because of the hairs.
This feels like something different. It does not look inflamed from the outside, and it is not sore to touch just a bit tender. It feels like it rolls underneath my skin but stays in the same spot obviously.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
If I am not wrong 5 cents Australian piece is around  2 cm in size. As you have described, it is a lymph node in your inguinal region. The human body has about 600 lymph nodes. Their role is to clean antigens from the extracellular fluid. It helps in fighting inflammation and infection.
Lymphadenopathy LAP is the term to describe the conditions in which lymph nodes become abnormal in size, consistency, and number. A normal-sized lymph node is usually less than 1 cm in diameter. An inguinal lymph node size up to 1.5 cm should be considered normal.
Lymphadenopathy can be called generalized when it affects two or more parts of the body. Enlarged lymph nodes associated with significant fever, night sweats, and unexplained weight loss more than 10 in less than six months are considered as red flags. It required an urgent evaluation for lymphoma. Those are not present in your case.
Pain and tenderness on a lymph node is a non-specific finding. It is typically due to minor infection. Other causes of the inguinal lymph node are benign reactive lymphadenopathy, sexually transmitted disease, cellulitis or local infection, etc. Benign reactive inguinal lymphadenopathy is seen in patients who walk barefooted outdoors.
If it is tender you can take Paracetamol. Keep watch. Avoid walking barefoot. Keep hygiene of your private parts. If it persists and associated pain or fever or other site engaged lymph nodes, you will need an evaluation.
I hope this helps.

With your description, I feel you are suffering from a fungal infection of your genitalia. Kindly stop Candid-B cream Beclometasone Topical and Clotrimazole Topical. It has steroids in it. This gives you temporary relief from itching but promotes fungal growth. However, I cannot precisely diagnose your condition without having seen your clinical picture.

Seriva Sertaconazole Topical cream to the affected area. Apply a thin layer afterbath in the morning and at night before sleeping.
Abzorb Clotrimazole, Talc, and starch dusting powder. Apply on top of the cream to the thigh folds.
KZ Ketoconazole soap - use only in the genital area while taking a bath. Use your routine soap for the rest of the body.
Tablet Teczine Levocetirizine 5 mg at night after food for 10 days for itching. Never scratch the area, use dry underwear all the time. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and with their consent take the medicine.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I can understand your concern about your symptoms, There are many reasons for premature ejaculation
Stressful work  night duties, twenty-four-hour jobs.
Diabetes, hypertension, and thyroid issue have an effect on premature ejaculation. Keeping your blood sugar, blood pressure, and thyroid hormones under control will help you.
Long-term medication related to hypertension and anti-psychiatric medications.
Frequent masturbation or prone masturbation.
Excess porn.
Receiving less foreplay from a partner or lack of knowledge regarding foreplay and female masturbation.
Having an affair gives you a guilty feeling.
Lack of exercise, and obesity.
You need to check FBS fasting blood sugra or PPBS to rule out diabetes, check your BP, and free T3, T4, and TSH to rule out thyroid issues. You can use the tablet Duralast 30 mg as a temporary solution. A natural method to increase the foreplay and its duration during sex women should receive 15 to 20 minutes of foreplay and men should receive ten to fifteen minutes of foreplay for a good blood supply to the penis for a long and hard erection. Foreplay should be in a relaxed manner. Your partner should learn to give foreplay in a way you do not ejaculate and enjoy. You can try relaxing music and condoms can help you delay ejaculation. Inserting the penis into the vagina is not everything in sex. Sex is not a race and its duration does not mean your partner is happy. Love your partner, learn about female masturbation, and give your partner an orgasm or climax. Your size is normal.

"Hi doctor,
A month ago, I had protected sex, and then two weeks ago, I started getting a rash on my right arm near the wrist. I consulted a doctor who thought it might be shingles. He then put me on a seven day regimen of Famciclovir. Over the next week, I got another blister on the back of the arm, the other arm, my leg, my hip, and the back of my foot. This past week, I now have more on my neck, upper back, and right forearm. This one is harrowing. I have not got a single rash or blister on or anywhere near my genitals or anus. Please help.
Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern.
Shingles are usually excruciating and respond to antiviral therapy like Famciclovir. You might have monkeypox instead, which can be similar to the description you are telling here. For that, you do not need to worry. You must isolate yourself until all lesions are crusted and fall off. You can confirm that in the hospital with a swab from the lesions called PCR polymerization chain reaction test. It can also ensure or rule out shingles when done for it.
I hope this information will help you.

TB tuberculosis is a contagious disease. If that person is open-type TB sputum positive, you must take precautions. I suggest waiting and watching. The incubation period is a minimum of 3 to 45 days.

I understand your concern. I had a look at the photo you sent attachment removed to protect patient identity. It is a bit blurry, and unfortunately, if there is a foreign body or an eyelash embedded under the upper eyelid, it will not be visible in the photo. Is your lower eyelid swollen by any chance? I could only see one eye in the photo, so I could not compare. The treatment options you have are if there is someone with you right now. You can attempt to evert the upper eyelid with your finger and ask them to have a look with a torchlight. Secondly, you can fill a clean bowl with water and dip your eye into it with your eye open and blink a few times to dislodge it. Thirdly, I noted that you are already on lubricating eye drops, so you can use it every hour or so to dislodge it. If you notice that the lower eyelid is swollen, you will have to use an antibiotic eye drop as it might be a lid infection.

I think that I have developed some kind of a lump or a bubble overnight under my tongue. I am just wondering whether I should be concerned or not. It has not happened overnight but I only noticed it this morning however I could be wrong.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern. If the lump is big enough to be held by your finger when you palpate physically, it may need a biopsy. However, from the photo that you have shared attachment removed to protect the patients identity, it looks like a common ranula to me. If the sublingual salivary glands are blocked or there is  some minor obstruction, then a ranula can form. I suggest you to start rinsing with warm salt water several times a day, and start using a Chlorhexidine mouthwash. Usually a ranula is self-limiting and resolves on its own. I advise you to observe for the next two days if it is reducing in size or not. I will suggest you surgical excision of ranula only if it does not resolve after rinsing and mouth washing. I suggest that you can also use a Lidocaine 2 and Benzocaine oral pain  gel  to that area to reduce the size.","{'score': 95, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 5, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 83, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 7}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"

"Hi doctor,
I have high MCV, MCH, and MCHV. I also have high B12 levels. What does this mean? I have stomach upset, diarrhea and I pass stool after every meal within an hour. My stool seems to be yellow or orange-brown in color. I have a past history of food intolerance and allergy. Currently, I am taking Esmoprazole when I have difficulty while managing my stomach upset.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Following is my opinion for your asked question. In the attached report attachment removed to protect patient identity, MCV mean corpuscular volume, MCH mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and MCHC mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration is in high range within borderline. All other CBC complete blood count parameters are within range. So do not be worried about it. It can occur due to nonspecific findings. Your B12 remains slightly high. It can occur due to intake of multivitamin supplement probably if you have taken it in the last few days. If you do not have a history of any multivitamin intake then kindly investigate with SGPT alanine transaminase, and serum protein estimation to check for liver disease, serum urea, and creatinine to check for renal function. Myeloproliferative blood disorder can also elevate B12 but it does not seem to be a cause in your case as your CBC is normal. B12 is a water-soluble vitamin and so it gets excreted from the body in the next few days. Do not be worried. Hope I have answered your questions. Let me know if you have more questions in your mind.

"Hi doctor,
I am a 31-year-old male. I have been having blurry vision and photophobia for the past year and have been getting my eyes checked every six months dilated. Recently I was diagnosed with steroids induced OHT and allergic conjunctivitis. But the doctor has prescribed me two tests OCT and HVF. I read that these two tests are for glaucoma. But after a dilated eye exam doctor said that all is fine. I want to know why these tests are referred to? Or will glaucoma and chances of glaucoma be caused by OHT from ten months of mild steroid use? Eye pressure was 24 and 24 when diagnosed, and in two days, it dropped to 16 and 14 after using drops twice a day. In the past, I use to take CMC, FML, and Ketorolac.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
The steroid-induced intraocular pressure rise is a real entity. You have just sent the latest prescription, but what about the earlier ones? Steroid drop use can lead to intraocular pressure rise after two weeks of the start of the drops, which generally drops on discontinuation of the steroid eye drops. Long-term steroid usage can lead to intraocular pressure IOP rise and damage to the optic nerve and visual fields. Though you have not sent me pictures of the reports I recommend you to send those, it seems you only had intraocular pressure rise without any optic nerve damage. But maybe there is a chance that intraocular pressure may rise again after discontinuing the IOP-lowering drug Timolol. If the IOP remains stable even after discontinuation of Timolol, then you need not worry. Yes, the doctors were correct in carrying out the tests as there is a chance of developing glaucoma. Such tests need to be done at regular intervals. I hope it helps you.

"Hello doctor,My left cheek is swollen from TMJ, my mouth is not opening properly, and I do not have any tooth pain. Please suggest the treatment.Thanking you.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have read your query and understand your concern.
Firstly, the swelling in the left cheek has multiple reasons if it is near the TMJ Temporo mandibular joint area. It can be because of a wisdom tooth infection. You will not feel pain, but the gum surrounding the tooth may cause infection and swelling if the tooth is not completely erupted.
The second thing is if any teeth have cavities in the upper jaw or lower jaw, sometimes you will not get any pain, and the tooth becomes fully infected, leading to swelling. Another probability is salivary gland infection or blockage and it can also lead to also leads to swelling in the TMJ area see if swelling increases while taking food. Is there any fever or pain in the swelling area?
I suggest you start antibiotics as soon as possible, and check for any medicine allergies. Take Amoxiclav Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid 625 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg for orofacial infections three times a day after a meal.
Caution  Not to do hot fermentation on the swelling area. It will increase otherwise, and try not to sleep on the left side.
You can add warm saline rinses three to four times a day. This will decrease the swelling and add pain killer if it is painful. Take muscle relaxants,, if you cannot open the mouth, like tablet Zerodol-MR Aceclofenac and Tizanidine, three times a day. Take curd and water as much as possible during the medicine course.
I suggest you visit a dentist and have an X-ray and OPG orthopantomagram so that he can diagnose the problems cause and treat it properly.

"Hello doctor,
I suspect I might be color blind, and it is impacting my daily life. Can you offer personalized information on the specific type of color blindness I may have, potential causes, and any strategies or tools that can help me navigate color-dependent tasks more effectively based on my unique perception?
Please help.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I went through your query.
Color blindness occurs when cone cells, located in the retinal tissue at the back of the eye, do not function or are damaged. There are two main kinds of color blindness
Red or green color blindness, the most common type, is congenital or inherited. It is far more common in males than females, but still very rare. It affects five to eight percent of males and 0.5 percent of females. For people with red or green color blindness, reds and greens look similar to each other in a kind of brownish, muted tone. There is also a blue or yellow type of color blindness, but it is rare.
A second, and less common, kind of color blindness is acquired, or related to an eye disease or condition. Retinal or optic nerve disorders are most likely to cause this kind of color blindness. In these cases, symptoms such as overall failing vision or persistent dark or white spots may be noticed first. An ophthalmologist may test for color blindness to help diagnose the problem. The doctor may start with an Ishihara screening test and, if that is positive, move to more sophisticated testing.
Hope it helps.

I understand your concern about your colon polyp. The risk of having a cancerous change in a new polyp is 1 to 2 percent and it takes around 5 years. Your fear has decreased your quality of life.

I am very frightened by them and I am terrified that I have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD, as it seems to appear from the numbers.

Welcome to icliniq.com. Percentage predicted means how much is your observed value to the expected value. The computer predicts based on your height, age and gender and on equations how much your FEV1 forced expiratory volume and FVC forced vital capacity values should be if you are normal. Then in the test we calculate how much are your actual values. To say as normal in FEV1 and FVC we want your calculated value to be not less than 80 percent of your expected. That is 80  predicted. Here your FEV1 is 71  percentage predicted. As per values it suggests COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. But few observations, 1.

Thank you for your query. I understand your concern. You seem to have a lacrimal sac infection known as dacryocystitis. I suggest you to follow a few instructions. Take the tablet Amoxclav 625 mg thrice daily for three days. Take tablets containing Diclofenac and Serratiopeptidase once daily after meals for five days. Take a tablet of Pantoprazole 40 mg every empty morning stomach. Take the tablet Moxifloxacin eye drop six times a day for next week. Use Tobramycin eye drop four times a day for next week. Apply Polymixin and Chloramphenicol eye ointment at bedtime for five days. After completing this course, you have to get a test of syringing done to rule out the blockage.

"Hi doctor,
From time to time, I get a weird lightheaded sensation. I feel such a weird sensation while reading, looking at my cell phone, watching television, or driving at night. For a moment, I feel as though I may pass out. But, I do not pass out, and it goes away quickly. Sometimes it happens a few times in a row. Afterwards, it is followed by pain behind my eyes and a slight headache. But that does not last long. What could this be? This has been going on for a couple of months now. It happened a year or so ago, when I was on blood pressure medication. But it has stopped until my recent episodes in the past couple of months.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
The most likely reasons for such episodes are likely to be hypoglycemia or hypotension. Both can manifest in similar presentations with mild dizziness followed by headaches. It is necessary that you should get your blood sugar levels and your blood pressure levels duly monitored. If you are found to have low blood pressure, then you need to increase your water intake, and if you have hypoglycemia, then prevention would have to be followed. You should get an examination done at your physicians office and make an informed decision.","{'score': 95, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 5, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 83, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor, My mother is suffering from DVT which was diagnosed just yesterday. I want a second opinion on her treatment and Doppler results. The doctor said that there is no need to admit her in the hospital and he prescribed Rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily for 21 days along with Ibuprofen 400 mg. Also, injection Enoxaparin Sodium was given. Esomeprazole was given to prevent upset stomach and microfibre cloth stocking was given to wear from morning until bedtime. I am worried about the amount of clots in her leg. Are the treatment and medications given optimum? How long will she have to take anticoagulant medication? Is she safe from pulmonary embolism now that the treatment has started? How much walk is recommended? She is also diabetic and hypertensive and takes Glycophage 750 mg and Concor2.5.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I can understand your concern. The following are the answers of your asked questions.
Yes, your mother has been put on the best anticoagulant medication. Rivaroxaban and Apixaban are the best anticoagulant oral drugs. Enoxaprin is injectable anticoagulant drug to treat blood clots. So given treatment is the best and optimum.
She needs to take Rivaroxaban for at least three months. Some doctor prefer to use it for six months. After 21 days, Rivaroxaban dose has to be changed to 20 mg once a day.
Pulmonary embolism has to be ruled out by CT computerized tomography pulmonary angiography and D-dimer. If it is not developed with medication pulmonary embolism can be prevented. Advise her only mild to moderate degree exercise. Ask her to walk only for 30 minutes maximum.
Additionally, I want to say that her HbA1c glycated hemoglobin is high. So treat her diabetes as well after consulting your doctor.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
You seem to be suffering from vasomotor rhinitis. It is slightly different from allergic rhinitis.
To be sure we need to get more details
Does rhinitis get triggered when you inhale dusty and polluted air?
Does it worsen when you go close to flowers and pollen?
Does it cause a nose block or a running nose?
Does it cause itching of the nose and eyes?
Does it cause watering of the eyes?
Does it cause sneezing? Is it associated with thick nasal discharge?
Do you get a headache? Is there a reduced sense of smell?
Do you get asthmabreathing trouble?
Treatment for vasomotor rhinitis is intranasal corticosteroids, but we need to be sure of the diagnosis.

"Hello doctor,
I took a home pregnancy test 44 days after my last LMP. I underwent my pelvic scan today and it says I have no gestational sac and have a thick endometrium. I have very mild bleeding for the past two days and slight press on my right lower abdomen. My doctor has suggested me to take hCG at a lab and I was also told my periods will come anytime. My concern is that I have a flight journey of seven hours in another 48 hours. Is it safe to travel? What are the precautions that I need to exercise?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
You can definitely take a long flight. What you had was a biochemical pregnancy  meaning pregnancy hormones only in blood and urine and not on the scan. Urine pregnancy is positive when the blood level of beta hCG human chorionic gonadotropin hormone is  25 IUmL. But only if the baby is healthy and gets a good place to sit in the uterus, will it produce the beta hCG at the expected rate and only when the level is more than 1500 IUmL, it can be seen on the scan. As pregnancy was not so healthy, urine pregnancy test was weakly positive and I am sure the beta hCG will be negative or very low as it is supposed to be more than 3000 IUmL at six weeks.
You might have taken some hormone pills for pregnancy growth. This along with hormone form failing pregnancy will make endometrium thicker. If you do not want to have the bleeding during the flight, you can continue hormones like Duphaston Dydrogesterone twice a day until you reach the destination. After few days of stopping the pills, you will have thick fleshy bleeding with clots. There is nothing to worry about.
If you do not mind the bleeding, keep a few extra pads handy. You can also take some antispasmodic medicines like Cyclopam Dicyclomine and Paracetamol or Spasmo Proxyvon  Dicyclomine, Paracetamol, and Tramadol or Hyocimax Hyoscine butylbromide or Drotin Drotaverine two to three times as a precaution. Some may have slightly painful lower abdominal cramps. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and with their consent take the medicines.You need to have a lot of fluids, water, juices, tea, and coffee. Try to relax whenever possible. You may feel the tiredness which is seen during normal periods.

"Hello doctor,I have hemoglobin E-Beta thalassemia and have been undergoing treatment for 14 years, including blood transfusions and medications such as Folic acid, Vitamin B complex, Hydroxyurea, and chelation therapy with Deferasirox, Deferoxamine, or Deferiprone, depending on my condition. Over the last four months, I have not required a blood transfusion, and my hemoglobin Hb level is at 8.2 gdL, with a 56 Hb variant. However, I have been experiencing abdominal pain and fatigue, though I do not feel particularly weak.It is worth noting that I work as a banker and often have to eat lunch at restaurants or other places. Due to my busy schedule and the lack of a nearby hematologist, I have not been in contact with my doctor for 18 months. My last recorded serum ferritin level was 1236 ng, approximately a year and a half ago.

If you have any other recommendations, I would be open to your suggestions as I seek to improve my quality of life.Thank you.","Hello,Welcome to icliniq.com.I understand your concern. Pain in the abdomen could result from gastritis caused by consuming outside food. You can take a capsule Rabeprazole 20mg once daily for seven days. If necessary, a Helicobacter pylori test, such as the urea breath test, can be performed. Consider including yogurt in your diet and avoid consuming excessively spicy foods. Regarding your hemoglobinopathy, you may require iron tablets or injections. If your hemoglobin Hb does not improve, a blood transfusion may be necessary. Iron chelation therapy is typically administered when the serum ferritin level exceeds 1200. Therefore, please have your ferritin level checked again. Both oral chelation and subcutaneous infusion can be considered. The course of action will be determined after reevaluating your serum ferritin levels. If a hematologist is not available, you can consult a physician for an examination and receive further prescription accordingly.Hope this will help you.

"Hello doctor,
My brother is 32 years old. He is suffering from a strange medical problem. For the last couple of years, he has been vomiting blood. The problem has worsened recently, with the blood coming from the nose and the mouth. This happens at least three to four times a week. Because of this problem, he has become really weak and has lost a lot of weight in the past six months. He also has a grade 3 hiatus hernia and PAN gastritis. We have seen many doctors to find out the root cause of his problem, but there was no luck. I had taken him to a gastroenterologist, who asked us to see a hematologist as he did not find any reasons for vomiting blood. After a few tests, the hematologist asked us to see an ENT and now we are visiting an ENT specialist. He has recommended septoplasty for his nose as he thinks that will solve the problem. Several tests, including CT scan of the chest, ultrasound and endoscopy of the abdomen, CT scan of the PNS paranasal sinus, blood tests like PT prothrombin time, PTT partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, and factor XIII have been done in the past for this problem, but nothing came out. Currently, he is taking Nasomist nasal spray and Liquid Paraffin. I am still not convinced if the procedure recommended by the ENT doctor will cure the root cause of the problem. Please help.","Hi,

I want to assure you that, you do not have to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted. This looks to me a case of epistaxis bleeding from the nose and it is not a simple one. It has got two important medical reasons attached to the disease history. His deviated nasal septum or he has nasal polyps in the sinuses. These two are the main concerns that need to be treated on a selective basis and surgery is the best option. As he also has GERD gastroesophageal reflux and hiatal hernia, he needs a proper time to time follow up with a gastroenterologist. Endoscopic nasal septoplasty and polypectomy are the surgical procedures needed. It can be handled with care by experienced hands of an otorhinolaryngologist. I suggest him to take Pantocid-L Pantoprazole for the stomach and esophagus issues. It will help to maintain normal motility of the stomach and will relieve acidity in the stomach.

It is not mostly just dark acne scars and I want to get rid of them. My skin also turned from combination to dry on my entire face. My forehead is a little bit itchy sometimes and so are my eyelids.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have been through your case. Well, acne is common in your age. Drink plenty of water and juices. Avoid fast food and chocolates. Even then you may have frequent relapses which are precipitated by stress, periods, and cosmetics.
For daily routine healthy skin, do the following
Apply Clindamycin gel two times a day on these lesions.
Avoid eyelid treatment like mascara, eyeshadows as much as you can.
Use Neutrogena anti-acne fash wash.
For dryness, apply simply vaseline lotion as there are two types of lotions water based or oil based.
Vaseline is water based. If you used oil based lotion it may aggravate your acne-like lesions. Even this lotion you should apply first on your palms and then gently tap on your dry face. Do not apply too much.
Use gel shampoo because sometimes dandruff can also cause dryness over eyelids.
First, use only this. If still, your dryness would not go away then we need to go on steroids, not now.","{'score': 88, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 6, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

Yes, you can opt for tubal ligation during cesarean section but you have to give consent for the same prior to the cesarean section. Usually, the doctor proceeds with the ligation only after the pediatrician confirms that the baby is doing fine. If not, then you will be informed on the table and the doctor usually avoids the procedure considering the condition of the neonate.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I read your query and can understand your concern.
Your mother seems to have symptomatic COVID-19 with predominantly GI gastrointestinal symptoms. Two important things to be monitored in COVID-19 are SPO2 oxygen saturation in the blood which hopefully should be fine as she does not have many respiratory symptoms, and second blood pressure, which may drop in patients with GI involvement, as in her case. Hydration is important with rest, and I suggest the tablet Paracetamol 500 for fever and body aches.
COVID is a self-limited disease and settles in five to seven days. The patient needs rest, monitoring of blood pressure, and SPO2. If possible, I suggest taking medications like the tablet Pantoprazole before breakfast and Ondensteron 4 mg mouth dissolving, which would take care of vomiting. However, please consult a physician, discuss with them and start taking the medications with their consent.
Hope this helps.

I have gone through your query and medical history along with the attached reports attachment removed to protect patient identity. The problem does not seem to be due to the fused C3-4 or C4-5 levels. In fact a disc prolapse at C5-C6 with nerve compression is causing the present symptoms. I would suggest you to go for physiotherapy sessions  including cervical traction along with neck strengthening passive and active exercises, SWDIRT. It would always be better to avoid going through another surgery considering the post-operative complications. Hence, in my personal opinion, you should avoid a re-surgery and go for conservative line of management. Analgesics, anti-inflammatory tablets, hot fomentation and use of cervical soft collar will help.

"Hi doctor,
I have pain in the last tooth of the upper jaw. Please suggest me some medication to get relief.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have gone through the attachment attachment removed to protect patient identity. Your tooth structure is fine. But third molars are always susceptible to infection. So do not worry and pain will get reduced soon. Report to a nearby dental hospital for radiograph after three days. Thus, if there is any caries, it can be detected and addressed accordingly.
Take these medications for pain for three days. Take tablet Ordent Ofloxacin 200 mg with Ornidazole 500 mg twice daily for three days. Use Hexidine mouthwash once daily and rinse for 15 seconds in the mornings for 15 days. Take tablet Ketorolac 10 mg as needed.

"Hello doctor,
A week back, I slipped and injured my right thumb. There was a cut just below the top side nail with lots of bleeding. The doctor had bandaged it, and the wound seems to have healed.

"Hello doctor,What are the symptoms to watch for when you have a tooth infection? I need two root canals and have four cavities.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Cavities might not be symptomatic in many cases apart from mild to moderate sensitivity. The same cavities if left in place for a longer duration without treatment, then it would go deeper or wider causing trouble. You can expect pain on a particular tooth or generalized pain. In addition ,you can also expect swelling of gums with pus discharge or swelling of face in worst case scenarios. The tooth with any sort of pain has to be looked upon for a root canal therapy initially. Upper back teeth might give you pain simulating sinusitis whereas lower back teeth come along with ear pain.","{'score': 96, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,
Almost 14-16 days back,  was feeding a four to seven months old stray his owner is actually out of his mind and does not take care of the pup nor its diet, so I consider it a stray pup, and he innocently actually took both my fingers in his mouth while I was feeding him biscuit. As a reflex action, I immediately pulled my hand back. I found that because of this, I sustained a small scratch on the skin of the thumb behind my nails. It was so small, and I do not know how to explain it. There was orangish-colored blood on the borders of that scratch, and the blood was just smaller than a drop. But I was worried, so I immediately came home and washed that area with detergent soap for five minutes by rubbing the detergent on the area twice and then I placed my thumb in concentrated Dettol since I was worried about rabies.
Due to some circumstances, I could not get the rabies shot on the very day of the exposure and also not within the prescribed time of 24-48 hours. So, I kept observing the puppy for 14 more days. Considering the nature of its owner, I assumed that the pup would not have been vaccinated. There was nothing unusual in the pups behavior and when I observed the pup on the 14th day, he tried to bite and lick the concrete paver block though not very furiously. To be on the safer side, I somehow managed to get the rabies vaccine on the 14th day.
The doctor said it was too late, but he gave me an IndiRab vaccine injection on the 14th day after the exposure and set the dosage as 0,7,28, 1 year, and 5 years which is the dosage of pre-exposure and not post-exposure. But today, it is almost 16-17 days after the exposure, and I found the dog eating and drinking normally. He is listening, eating biscuits, sitting, standing, and walking normally. He does not bark or act furious, and there is no foaming, no salivation, and no mandibular malfunction. He just behaves very slowly. I have had no symptoms of rabies till today. I just had a mild fever, body ache joint ache, and pain in the injected arm which came and went away, and I assume these symptoms to be due to the vaccine that I took yesterday. However, I have no fever or joint aches at present. I am a microbiology student, and I know the insights and effects of viruses which freaks me a lot. Please let me know the following
Whether I need to change the doctor because of his incorrect dosage schedule and is giving pre-exposure dosage for a post-exposure case? And if so, do I need to change him before the dosage for day seven or change the doctor immediately to get the dosage on day three instead?
Am I still at risk because I started the vaccine after the 14th day of exposure though the dog is still fine till the 17th day and I have no clinical symptoms either?
Are the vaccines that I am taking now, ineffective and will not protect me because it is too late?
Do I need to have rabies immunoglobulins because it is too late?
I must tell you that I had the rabies vaccine when I was about two to three years old and I was scratched by a kitten. Two more stray dogs play with this suspected pup, but they have not shown any symptoms either in the course of the last 16-17 days. Please help me. I am much worried and freaked and do not know what to do.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I am here to extend a helping hand to you.
Being a microbiology student yourself, you might know things well. The answers to your questions are as follows
1. Whether I need to change the doctor because of his incorrect dosage schedule and is giving pre-exposure dosage for a post-exposure case? If so, do I need to change him before the dosage for day seven or change the doctor immediately to get the dosage on day three instead?
My suggestion is that choosing a doctor is your personal choice.
2.  Am I still at risk because I started the vaccine after the 14th day of exposure though the dog is still fine till the 17th day, and I have no clinical symptoms either?
There is no 100  in medical science. As per the literature, if the dog is healthy by the 10th day, PEP post-exposure prophylaxis may be discontinued. But literature does not strongly say that it must be discontinued.
3. Are the vaccines that I am taking now, ineffective and will not protect me because it is too late?
No test is available for this. But you are still healthy.
4. Do I need to have rabies immunoglobulins because it is too late?
There is no need to have the immunoglobulin now.
For more information, you can refer the World Health Organization WHO guidelines.
I hope this helps.

Chickenpox is a very simple issue in children. Do not worry.

Lactocalamine lotion to apply all over the body thrice a day. This will reduce itching and redness.
Paracetamol 250 mg 3 ml three to four times a day for the fever and also pain due to the rash.
Antibiotic is not required for him.
Give him warm water baths, not hot or else his skin will become dry and cause more itching. If the lesions are secreting pus in any form they might be infected. Please take him to a dermatologist immediately if that is the case.

"Hello doctor,
I got MRI of my body done eight years back. The results were good. The radiologist did not find anything clinical relevant. The past three months I suffered from several weird conditions. Ringing in the ears, while the tones shift in frequency I guess this is not an usual aspect of tinnitus, sometime seeing stars or flashes and headaches. I decided to make a new MRI of my brain, to make sure everything is normal.
The new MRI shows some differences compared to the one made earlier. I was pretty shocked when I saw the images. In regard of a second opinion, I  would like some more information about   abnormalities found in the recent MRI, just to get as much information as possible about my brains health. I would like to ask you a few questions regarding the images from my latest MRI.
1. Could you give your opinion about the images and possible abnormalities?
2. Could you explain about the cortexes where the possible abnormalities are in?
3. Is the area around my mouth or sinuses in the recent MRI looking normal?
4. What is the bright spot in picture 13a?
5. What is the bright straight line at the hight of my nose at picture 11?
Cancer appears in the family and I just wanted to be sure. I do not have dental implants. Do you notice anything strange around the mouth area?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
After having gone through the images, my first message to you is Nothing to worry attachment removed to protect patient identity. Absolutely nothing to worry or simply think about. Just wash them out of your mind. All you need to do is lead a healthy life with healthy habits. My findings in your recent MRI
Prominent cisterna magna aka mega cisterna magna, tiny T2-bright spot in the right lentiform nucleus, likely representing an old tiny infarct. Retention cyst in right maxillary sinus. None of these findings have any clinical significance, nor do they have any significant effect on your living or longevity. The old tiny infarct is tiny enough that you never knew that it was there. However, if it were larger, it could have troubled your living, so it is something to remain conscious about.
Mega cisterna magna enlarged CSF space behind cerebellum occurs in 1 of people and is mostly considered a harmless normal variant. However, people with MCM are often considered to be prone to infarcts, so it would be advisable that you avoid or control other factors that also cause infarcts, especially when there is already an infarct thankfully tiny, though like controlling hypertension  diabetes if you have, avoiding smoking and alcohol, etc.
Retention cyst is a fluid-containing pouch that can develop in the nasal sinuses. It is harmless, in fact not worth mentioning. Your mouth and sinuses do look normal, except for the retention cyst in the right maxillary sinus. Unfortunately, none of your files is labeled 13A. However, there is a bright spot - it is the retention cyst in the right maxillary sinus. The bright line is an artifact generated by the machine during imaging or image processing.
Regarding your worries over familial cancer, there is nothing your brain MRI to increase your worries. Perhaps regular follow-up is sufficient. I asked about dental implants because without the DICOM images, I was a bit confused whether the bright spot representing the retention cyst was in the sinus or in the gums or teeth. Now, I am confirmed that it is in the sinus and your teeth sockets are normal.","{'score': 80, 'clinical_accuracy': 15, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 7, 'transparency': 8}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 40, 'clinical_accuracy': 0, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 5}"

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern.
Let me give you a few basic facts. The period occurs 14 days after ovulation. So if you take the average minimum and maximum periods frequency of the last year and subtract 14 from these two numbers, you will get the rough dates of ovulation. This will be around the 14th day of the period. The egg will stay alive for 24 hours. Sperm will stay alive in the uterus and tube for three days.    So I do not see any chance of pregnancy. The egg will be ready on day eight, and the sperm will not stay alive till the 14th.    Further, your dosage of Ipill will make the lining of the uterus unfavorable for the implantation of an embryo. So you will have periods in the next 7 to 10 days. So it is almost certain that you will not get pregnant.","{'score': 84, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 7}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 93, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}"

You should visit a doctor immediately since it is a chemical injury. Even after washing your eyes, if the vision is blurry and there are spots on the eye, then you will need treatment. Chemical injuries are of two types - acidic and alkaline. They can damage the cornea.Once the cornea is damaged, then it is difficult to treat and can become chronic. Immediate treatment is of prime importance. They might start with antibiotics and steroids if any trauma is there. They should repeat the vitreous eyewash to remove the gel particles.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Relax and do not worry. This issue is very common in young females of your age, so nothing to worry about. I have some questions for you. Have you done a urine test? Does it happen only after having sex? I think cystoscopy or urodynamic study is not required at present for your case. I suggest you have an ultrasound abdomen and pelvis report, which are the primary test to rule out any pathology in the urinary tract. I advise you to drink plenty of water. Always empty your urinary bladder before and after sex and maintain proper perineal hygiene. You can take cranberry extracts daily as prophylaxis. If the problem occurs only after sex, you can start antibiotics only after having sex for three to five days instead of taking antibiotics daily. If the problem is not related to sex, then you can have daily low-dose prophylaxis. I suggest the drug Bactrim Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim.

This is regarding my friends dad, aged 76-years-old. He has had recurrent urinary tract infections in the past three months, and every time the culture shows up, some bacteria, I guess, E Coli. He also strains while passing urine and has weak power stream. He has also already taken Nitrofurantoin, Augmentin duo, and Levobact 750 mg, but the recent culture still shows E coli. He has had high blood pressure and diabetes for the past 20 years, but well-maintained fasting blood sugar is usually between 80- 100 mgdL, and BP is usually between 120- 130 mm Hg. He does not have a burning sensation while urinating, fever, pain in the back and has never seen blood in the urine. He is currently taking Urimax 0.4, Telma AT, Amlong 5 mg, and Glucomet tablets. Our doctor said there can be some blockage or obstruction and has suggested some tests like PSA and CT Urography. Please go through the attached reports and please clear our doubts,
Why is he always having infections and RBC in his urine? Why is it not going away after taking powerful and costly antibiotics? How to treat early renal parenchymal disease as seen on Ultrasound? He has albumin 80, creatinine 50, and Serum creatinine is 1.2 in urine. What does it signify, and how to treat it? Should we also do PSA and CTU as costly tests? What treatment do you advise?
Please guide us.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I will answer your questions. He is always having infections and RBC red blood cells in urine, which means whenever he is having UTI urinary tract infection, pus cells and RBC are bound to come. Sometimes the organism is resistant to oral antibiotics, so we have to switch to injectables. Moreover, sometimes antibiotics have to be taken for an extended period, say three months. The treatment of early renal parenchymal disease as seen on ultrasound is by strict control of diabetes or hypertension as well as proper UTI treatment. Albumin can occur in UTIs and diabetics. Once it gets settled, albumin should also get corrected. Sometimes even very good control of diabetes albumin can come. Urine and serum creatinine levels are normal. Lastly, I think you should have these tests done as all pathologies can not be picked in ultrasound. 6 What treatment do you advise? If there is a recurrent UTI, I will further investigate him based on CT computed tomography and switch to an injectable plus oral antibiotics combination. His post-void residual urine is significantly high, so I suggest you take tablet Urimax D HS Tamsulosin 0.4mg and Dutasteride 0.5mg for lifelong.,

According to your statement, you have recently undergone liver function tests, CBC complete blood count as well as lipid profile tests and found raised levels of cholesterol, LDL low-density lipoprotein, SGPT serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase and SGOT serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase.
Your cholesterol, LDL, SGPT and SGOT levels are not so high to indicate any specific abnormality. One blood picture does not confirm anything. Test results may vary from one laboratory to another laboratory due to sample collection technique, examination methods, use of reagents and many more.
Lifestyle modifications like weight reduction in case of being obese, proper rest and sleep, plenty of fluids intake, avoiding alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking, avoiding fatty and oily foods as well as dairy products, etc., may help to return your slightly raised parameters to a normal range. I suggest you to repeat your liver function tests and lipid profile one to two months later from two different laboratories. If you notice the abnormal results from two different laboratories, then consult your doctor and do the needful.
Hope this was helpful. Kindly revert for more queries.

"Hello doctor,
Based on my period calendar, I should have my menstruation yesterday, and I had unprotected sex on day before yesterday. Until now, I do not have menstruation, and I took the birth control pill as an emergency pill three days after that. Is there a big chance for me to get pregnant?
Kindly help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Thank you for your query.
Cycles could be late due to sudden weight gain or weight loss, strict diet, strenuous exercise, hormonal or drug intake, illness, hormonal imbalance, stress, anxiety, etc., if your cycles have been regular. One or two days before periods are not the fertile period of the cycle, so there are fewer chances of pregnancy. But the pill is hormonal contraception that affects the normal menstrual cycle to inhibit conception, and it was taken three days after unprotected sex. Then it interacts with body hormones, and cycles now should be in the form of withdrawal bleed within 1 to 2 weeks of post-pill. So wait and do not have other medications to interact further. So menstrual induction is required if you cannot get periods after two weeks. Then after having the tablet Primolute N 10 mg twice daily for five days again, you will have to wait for one to two weeks for bleeding. In this process, periods could be irregular due to the effects of hormones in the pill. As soon as you get rid of it, things will be better.
I hope this has helped you.

"Hello doctor,I am 70 but until recently have been very sexually active with my wife. I am in good health overall but have suffered from anxiety and depression my entire life. That usually has not interfered with my sex life. I have had a penile implant several years ago so getting an erection is not an issue. But for the past couple of months, I have not reached orgasm and ejaculated except when my wife tries through hand jobs to complete the orgasm. Even that is very delayed and seems like it takes forever. Sometimes I just give up because my wife gets weary and I feel guilty. My libido seems to be mostly in low gear but sometimes I am desiring but it does not work. I just had my testosterone level checked. It is in the mid 500. For 30 years, I have had to inject Depo-T 5 mil per week because I had low T related. I think of the long-term use of Prednisone to treat Crohns. It has been in remission for 10 years but I still take 10 mg Prednisone daily because my adrenals no longer function. My penile implant was due to Peyronies disease. For my depression, I am on 450 mg of Bupropion and just 2 mg of Abilify. I exercise one hour a day seven days a week, mostly swimming. But lately, during my sexual efforts, I sweat and get tired fast. I had a stress test and did great. So I am now desperate to be able to ejaculate during intercourse.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
You are in good health and has no serious co-morbid issue. You have main problem of delayed or no ejaculation. This could be occurring due to poor erection or reduced libido or anxiety. You are not on any anti-hypertensive so we can think of adding Sildenafil to your prescription. You can take 25 mg tablet and this should help in hard erection and should help in ejaculation. You should talk to your doctor before starting this drug.","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 88, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 83, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"

I can understand your concern for your symptoms. Your symptoms are consistent with indigestion.

Some patients who are prone for acidity might develop acidity following ayurvedic medicine. In this case, you should consider to discontinue Triphala also.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern.
Menopause is a stage when the hormones in your body are at a decreasing level, leading to various symptoms like hot flushes and nights with osteoporosis, making you more vulnerable to fractures. Apart from it, you may get heart problems and a chance of dryness of the vagina. Unless symptoms are very severe, you can have alternate therapy to reduce the effects of these postmenopausal effects.
First of all, to avoid osteoporosis, you should regularly take calcium in the form of milk, yogurt,yogurt etc. Secondly, you should have an active lifestyle, like doing exercise, yoga, or even a morning walk. At least one hour will keep you up to date, with an equal distribution of calcium in all of your bones. Thirdly, you should have a good nutritious diet with plenty of vitamin C and vitamin D in the form of sunlight, or you can have vitamin D capsules every month. These changes and supplements should reduce your hot flushes, and if you are not relieved, you can think of HRT hormone replacement therapy.

I have seen a lot of people saying you need to push to get the surgery. Can I get the surgery done if I do not have any major health issues?","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
A breast reduction surgery is a cosmetic procedure, and you can get it done after a proper assessment by a plastic surgeon or a breast oncoplastic surgeon who are involved in cosmetic surgery of the breast, such as an augmentation or reduction or even reconstruction. Depending upon your need, you can get it done. But bear in mind most of the procedures which are considered cosmetic are usually not covered by insurance companies hence you have heard of the term push  or a valid reason for your breast reduction procedure however, if you want to spend your own money and get the procedure down, you can get it done as soon as you require it.
Do rule out any other causes for your backache before you approach anyone for your breast surgery, as, at times, the cause for your neck and backache might be due to other causes.

When you start to have symptoms like increased facial hair, thinning of facial skin, redness, and burning during sun exposure, the darkness of skin, and acne-like lesions, then you should stop using Panderm cream.

You do not need to be apprehensive about this. Neuroendocrine tumors NETs of the appendix formerly carcinoids are rare and are usually detected incidentally as in your case in 1 of appendectomy specimens. They are preferentially located at the tip of the appendix. Tumors less than 1 cm hardly ever metastasize and are treated by appendectomy only. The overall prognosis of small appendiceal NET is excellent in all ages. For tumors as smaller as yours, a simple appendectomy is sufficient. So, just follow the scheduled follow-ups.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern.
Changes in menstrual patterns can occur due to various factors, including hormonal fluctuations, stress, changes in weight, and other underlying health conditions. For you, it is due to PCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome. The discomfort or pain you experienced during intercourse could be due to vaginal dryness, insufficient lubrication, infection, hormonal imbalances, or other underlying issues. Regarding the possibility of pregnancy, engaging in intercourse during your ovulation period increases the chances of conception. If you are concerned about pregnancy, it is recommended to take a pregnancy test. For evaluation of PCOS, you should get your basic blood reports, RBS random blood sugar checked, and hormonal assessment.
I hope this information will help you.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I studied your problem carefully.
You have to understand one crucial aspect of the vagina. It is like an elastic, which can stretch depending on the length and width of the penis. There are nerves only upto three inches in the vagina that is, only the front portion of the vagina can feel the pleasure of the penis, not the back portion. A three inch penis can also make a woman feel pleasure. The size of the penis is not at all the criteria to satisfy a woman. Discuss what she will enjoy or like you to do, and during sex, ask her which position she will be happy to try, etc.

According to the mentioned history, you are having pain in the testis and slight swelling is there. So, orchitis-like testicular inflammation has to be ruled out and for that, it is better to investigate with ultrasonography of the testis.

Thank you for your query. I read your query and understood your concern.
The risk of human immunodeficiency virusHIV transmission through activities like massage or breast contact is considered extremely low. Transmission of HIV through slight penis-vagina contact, as mentioned, is also highly unlikely. In my opinion, there is no need for HIV post-exposure prophylaxis PEP in this scenario. It is important to note that while the risk of HIV transmission is low, other sexually transmitted diseases, such as herpes simplex virus, can be transmitted through skin-to-skin contact or through kissing, especially if active lesions are present at the time of contact.

As your urine pregnancy test is negative, there is nothing to worry about. The delay could be because of hormonal changes.

"Hello doctor,
My mother was diagnosed with asthma nine years ago and used inhalers that the doctor prescribed. The doctors suggested that it might be due to climatic conditions, as she got an asthma attack during winters. This same pattern of asthma attacks repeated for the next five years. My mother had no episodes of asthma attacks for the next four years. We shifted to a new place one month ago, and my mother again had an asthma attack.

"Hello doctor,
I had protected sex during a few days before my period, which got delayed for eight days. I had period cramps for the first day that subsided later on. I also got pregnancy tests done, and they were negative. Kindly help.
Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I can understand your concern.
If you have had protected intercourse during the days you could potentially become pregnant, and you are experiencing symptoms such as period cramps and a missed period, you may be pregnant. However, it is also possible that you are experiencing a delayed period due to other factors, such as stress, hormonal imbalances, or an underlying medical condition.
If you have already taken two pregnancy tests and they were both negative, it is possible that the test was taken too early or that theres a chance of a false negative result. Pregnancy tests are most accurate when taken after a missed period, as this is when the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin hCG is at a high enough level to be detected by the test.
If you are still concerned about your symptoms and want to confirm whether or not you are pregnant, I suggest you follow the below-mentioned instructions.
Get a blood test done to determine the level of hCG in your body.
Follow a healthy diet, and get plenty of rest.
Avoid alcohol and tobacco products.
Kindly consult a specialist as they can guide you based on your circumstances.

"Hi doctor,
I have consulted a vascular radiologist for calf edema. There was no discomfort or redness. I am in my perimenopausal period.

Images were obtained using 2D grayscale B-mode imaging, Doppler spectral analysis, and color flow Doppler.
Findings

The doctor feels the targeted swelling is caused by a vein, though this is not common. However, he said the vein might still be the cause.
Since I suffer from medical anxiety, I would like to know if this doppler ultrasound shows lipoedema? I am confident he overlooked the lipoedema.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern.
From your statement, I understood that you have been experiencing leg swelling beneath the knee.
A venous Doppler ultrasonography is required for the diagnosis of lipoedema. Lipoedema has many characteristics of venous insufficiency, which may be validated with venous Doppler ultrasonography.
On the other hand, Lymphedema may be detected with Doppler ultrasonography and Lymphoscintigraphy.
Lipoedema is often symmetrical, affecting both sides of the body due to fat distribution.
Other medical diseases that might induce comparable clinical symptoms include primary valve deficit, protein C and S deficiency, popliteal cyst, deep vein thrombosis, post-surgical infection, leg ulcer or ischemia, and so on.
There is no need to be concerned because nothing further is revealed in the findings. Lipoedema is a benign illness with a good prognosis. However, it may be something else because venous Doppler ultrasound does not prove it.
Again, FNAC fine needle aspiration cytology or biopsy can be used to determine the underlying pathology of the swelling in the leg under the knee, after which you can begin therapy.","{'score': 91, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 91, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 80, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}"

In atrial fibrillation, the heart beats can vary in frequency and height amplitude. What is more important in these patients is that the rate needs to be controlled and not above 100 beats per minute. Also, one must make sure that no clot forms in the heart due to the abnormal heartbeats. I have seen the monitor pictures attachment removed to protect patient identity and they do not look concerning. One must make sure that there is no clot forming in the heart which can give rise to the stuttering nature of the stroke as in his case. I would recommend a transesophageal echocardiogram to detect the presence of thrombus in the left atrium. If the thrombus is present, he requires anticoagulation with heparin.

Could you tell me how long will it take to recover after the peel? Is it normal for the skin to turn dark even after 10 days after the peel?Kindy help.","Hello,
Welcome to iciniq.com.
Thank you for your query.
I understand your concern. Dark circle under the eyes or periocular hyperpigmentation is a common cosmetic concern, especially in females. Common causes of the dark circle are genetic, vascular, and extension of the pigmentary demarcation line. Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation due to continuous rubbing of eyes in allergic conjunctivitis and because of atopic dermatitis. Lack of adequate sleep, stress, etc. Chemical peels act through exfoliation, abrasion, and shedding of the superficial skin cells followed by remodeling without scarring. But sun protection is a must other it will lead to further darkening, or sometimes lead to irritant contact dermatitis, in your case this may be the cause. I suggest you to follow a few instructions mentioned below.
Avoid mid-day sun especially from 10 AM to 4 PM.
Seek shade whenever possible.
Wear broad-brimmed hats.
Apply Suncros soft gel sunscreen Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide, C-12-15 Alkyl Benzoate with SPF 50 daily in the morning all over the face can be repeated after 4 hours.
It usually takes six sittings of chemical peels required to show the result.

You may have parosmia or phantosmia. Parosmia is mostly due to neurological conditions like epilepsy. Phantosmia is olfactory hallucinations that are psychological.

"Hello doctor,
I am 31 years old. I am suffering from high BP and I am currently on medication. I have no thyroid issues, no diabetes, and normal lipids. Electrocardiogram ECG and echo both are normal. But, the main problem is a little breathing difficulty. The X-ray of the chest is clear normal but the high resolution computed tomography HRCT of the chest revealed early bronchiectatic changes. The question is what is the difference between early bronchiectatic changes and bronchiectasis? Is there any difference in the degrees? What is the treatment? I have a son with whom I am emotionally very attached. Can I at least live anormal lifespanwith treatment or is there any specific life expectancy of five years or so?

Welcome to icliniq.com. I saw your all reports attachment removed to protect patient identity and want to say something. Your probable diagnosis is bronchiectasis. Early bronchiectasis does not mean you are a patient of bronchiectasis. Also, you have atelectasis. So, send me a picture of the CT computed tomography scan and X-ray of the chest. You can try Aerodil Guaifenesin and Ambroxol syrup and tablet Acebrophylline SR 200 mg OD. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and with their consent take the medicines. You also can trypostural drainage of the sputum. Online information about this is available.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Sudden onset and offset of pain in the chest usually occur due to muscular and skeletal causes. It can also occur due to trauma. This pain aggravates with movements and deep breathing. The other cause of having this pain can be precordial catch syndrome. In this condition, chest pain aggravates with inspiration or expiration usually on the left side. In both cases, taking painkillers helps a lot. You need to remember that tenderness is not felt in the precordial catch syndrome. While in trauma, you can have tenderness. Anxiety can aggravate precordial catch syndrome and so avoid it. Doing simple exercise helps a lot. Sometimes, taking shallow breathing for a minute helps to relieve your pain, and sometimes taking deep respiration relieves pain in precordial catch syndrome.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"

Welcome to icliniq.com.Generally, fever lasts for 2 to 3 days. If it is viral or if it is bacterial, since you have started the antibiotic it takes 24 to 48 hours for the antibiotic to control infection. So, the fever may be there but the intensity will decrease gradually over 2 to 3 days. If the fever does not subside within 2 to 3 days of starting the antibiotic I suggest you go for further evaluation like blood tests.

"Hi doctor,My daughter, who is 20 years old, has a raised pink mole on her scalp. It has been there for several years. The one in question now has a purplish line running through it. My thought is that it is a visible blood vessel. Is it a change that requires seeing our dermatologist? Her dad passed away from melanoma. She is fair-skinned, has blond hair, and blue eyed. She has many moles on her body. She does see a dermatologist once a year. It is not her time yet, but I would certainly send her in if warranted.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
It can be nevus sebaceous. One of the differential diagnosis can also be viral warts. Nevus sebaceous can appear in the prepubertal age, which looks likesolitary, yellow-orange smooth, velvety plaques on the scalp. In postpubertal age, they look thickened, larger, waxy and more nodular as there is a massive development of sebaceous glands.
Diagnosis can be confirmed by skin biopsy. Also,dermoscopy would helpto diagnose. Surgical excision of sebaceous nevus is often recommended during childhood due to the potential risk of neoplastic transformation. However, most of the nevus are benign. I would suggest her to visit a dermatologist for a skin biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and further management.

"Hello doctor,
I am a medical graduate having trouble in sleeping. My psychiatrist told it is a panic disorder. First she gave me Escitalopram 10 mg for which I got akathisia, severe irritability and sleeplessness got aggravated. She later changed it to Fludac 20 mg in the morning at 8 AM. I did not have much inner restlessness or anxiety. As my final exams are approaching I felt this might be the cause. At night she put me on Clonazepam 0.25 mg and sleep was better. She tapered and this is the fourth week on Fluoxetine without Clonazepam. I do not have inner restlessness, but clouding of my consciousness and feel somewhat anxious because of lack of sleep. Can you please let me know why this Fluoxetine even though taken in the morning can cause insomnia at night? Shall I stop using this medication or can I switch to other medication? I guess that as I take Fluoxetine, I did not get sleep at night. I am a 28 year old male. My height is 510 and weight is 176 pounds.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Fluoxetine is known to cause significant insomnia in many patients as it is an activating drug. Even if it is taken early morning, it can still cause insomnia, particularly in the initial few days or weeks. My advice would be if you are doing well on Fluoxetine, apart from insomnia that is no panic, irritability or depression, then you can continue Fluoxetine in the morning. For sleep, you can take tablet Trazodone Oleptro 25 mg. It will be in the brand name of Traze, Trazolon and Trazaril. Take one tablet at night. It will ensure a good sleep and also reduce the edginess that people sometimes feel on Fluoxetine. Change of medicines is recommended when you are not doing good on Fluoxetine on other aspects apart from sleep. A medicine like Paroxetine could be used in such an instance as it does not cause insomnia.

"Hi doctor,
I am suffering from erectile dysfunction. I am 36 years old. I have used Sildenafil tablets for over eight months, and right now, I find it difficult to have an erection, and when I have one, it does not last long. I have been having issues with erection for the past four years. I used some medications and a skater herb as I am studying and not always around my wife.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern.
Erection problems can be due to lifestyle factors like taking alcohol, smoking, or being overweight. It may also be due to any major illness or some medicines. Often it can be due to stress or anxiety or blood abnormalities for which you need to do blood tests such as
Hb hemoglobin.
TC total count.
DC differential count.
Fasting blood sugar.
Prolactin.
TSH thyroid stimulation hormone.
Testosterone.
Walking half an hour daily will help. For example, if you are in an office job, get up from your chair every half hour and walk around for 5 minutes. It will help circulation in the penis.
Some couples practice a fertile period or ovulation method for sex, which stresses the partner by turning a pleasurable activity into a task, which leads to an erection problem. However, it can be overcome easily if they forget the ovulation time and have sex all through the month whenever possible.
Blood tests will help determine the cause, and taking only Sildenafil is ineffective. You will need dopaminergic medicines too.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 92, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 9, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

I hope your doing well. I understand that you are having PMS symptoms. Premenstrual disorders affect up to 12 of women. There are no unique physical findings or lab tests to positively diagnose premenstrual syndrome.
Recommendation from guidelines are

2. Oral contraceptives are effective for the treatment of PMS.
3. Calcium supplementation of 1,000 to 1,200 mg per day may improve PMS symptoms.
4. Cognitive behavior therapy may improve PMS and PMDD symptoms.  Sertraline Zoloft,  Fluoxetine Prozac, Citalopram Celexa, and Escitalopram Lexapro can be used. NSAIDs such as Ibuprofen Advil, Motrin IB, others or Naproxen sodium Aleve can ease cramping if taken before the onset of periods. Mindfulness-based exercises and acceptance-based cognitive behavior therapy may be helpful for reducing symptoms.
Migraines, anemia, endometriosis, and hypothyroidism may produce symptoms similar to PMS so they should also be considered. It will required an appropriate evaluation. You are taking serc Betahistine It is prescribed for vertigo.  For your symptoms of positional spinning. It can be easily diagnosed by doing BPPV maneuver, for the same your physician can help you.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Lack of concentration can be due to many reasons. From what I understand in your case is that you are under a lot of stress. When the brain is in stress, it tends to avoid the main task of finding relief by focusing on non-essential things.
The first thing you should do is take up measures to reduce stress. There are many such exercises on the internet, and you can pick the one that works for you.
Secondly, you should work on procrastination. Instead of studying for long hours, and draining yourself, take frequent breaks and use the Pomodoro technique. There are various skills you can learn to improve your concentration. There are many courses you can do.

"Hello doctor,
My previous periods were regular with a cycle of 28 to 32 days. Last month I had unprotected sex and consumed a contraceptive pill the next day. Periods did not start on the expected dates but bleeding occurred six days later. The flow was also similar to my periods. I expected my next period around two weeks late over 43 days cycle. later I had protected intercourse. we checked for leakages in the condom by squeezing it thoroughly, but there were none. About two weeks after the intercourse my bleeding started. it is about six days before my period was expected it is a normal flow, not spotting, and today is the fourth day and it is still going on. like my regular periods, it got heavier on the third day. Do normal periods last for five to six days? What could be the reason, can it be a side effect of the pill?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I read your query and understand your concern. Contraceptive pills have a high doses of Progesterone hormone, the same hormone which is produced in your body in the second half of the period after ovulation. This pill will suddenly increase the thickness of the inner lining of the uterus, making it unfavorable for a possible pregnancy to implant. As it is a single dose, it has no strength to stand on, so it falls off and you get period or bleeding of the increased thickness within seven to ten days of taking the pill. This bleeding will be thick, fleshy pieces, dark red or brown, with slight lower abdominal pain till the bleeding is reduced. This pill is very effective and you have taken the pill on time. So there is a very low chance of failure of contraception. But this will disturb your hormonal balance and also the subsequent periods. So this is not advisable to be taken very frequently. So if sex is going to be regular, use cyclical oral contraceptive pills or birth control pills. If sex is going to be occasional, the use of condoms is better. If protection is sure, then do not take the emergency pills unnecessarily. This will disturb the hormones and periods, causing a lot of anxiety. All these irregularities are due to the pills. I hope this helps, do write back if any more queries.

"Hello doctor,
Two years ago, I discovered a small lump in my neck near the back right side. My GP said it did not seem like anything to worry about and to come back if it grows. I noticed no growth, but it did not go away or shrink either. A year and a half later, I developed a rash and stomach bloating and cramping, so I went to another doctor and said I was concerned the lump is lymphoma and causing the other symptoms. The doctor ordered an ultrasound. The node measured 0.39 x 0.35 x 0.15 inches. The results said it has the appearance of a lymph node. The doctor said I could have an ENT look at it if I like, but that he thinks it is nothing to worry about. The rash and stomach pains cleared up soon after, so I did not pursue it further.
Now, last month I started to have chest tightness where my air passage felt like it was being restricted. I went to an urgent care and was put on Prednisone for ten days. The chest tightness has cleared up, but there is still a little irritation in my right lung area like I can feel something in my chest. The strangest thing is that after two days on Prednisone, I could no longer feel the lump in my neck. In two years, it had not changed, and after two days of Prednisone, I could not feel it. However, within 3 to 4 days after stopping the Prednisone, I could start to feel it coming back. It is now about two weeks since I have stopped the Prednisone and I can easily feel the lump now. It does not feel as large as before yet and would be hard for someone else to feel, but it has returned after stopping the Prednisone. I did some reading about how Prednisone can mask lymphoma symptoms, such as temporarily shrinking the nodes. Are there any other explanations for why a swollen lymph node that I have had for two years, would shrink while on Prednisone and then start to regrow after stopping it?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
The lymph nodes in the neck, if multiple and greater than 0.59 inches should be biopsied. Especially, if it is persistent for a long time. Most of the symptoms you have had are unrelated to lymphoma, but in a persistent lymph node, lymphoma should be ruled out. This is especially true if you do not have any other site of infection or injury in your scalp, mouth, teeth, gums, ear, nose, or throat to explain it. Regarding shrinking of nodes, whether lymphoma or otherwise most lymph node will shrink because of Prednisolone. This is because it suppresses bodys immune cell multiplication which occurs in both lymphoma and infections. So, better get yourself evaluated by a local medical oncologist. It mostly will turn out to be nothing significant, but still, rule it out.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 91, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 96, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have gone through your query and understand your concerns. I have reviewed the reports attachment removed to protect patient identity. The semen count is normal, but the motility is decreased.

"Hi doctor,
My question is regarding my grandmother. Lately, she has been acting differently, not her normal self, and the change in her behavior has been about two months now. She talks about things that do not make sense. She sometimes acts like a small child. She does pointless actions and always does something to stay busy when she is supposed to rest because her feet are extremely swollen, with leaking fluid and blisters. Apart from this, she is forgetting some things like forgetting that my sister was coming over to stay and also forgetting where she kept her dentures. I am not sure what kind of doctor I need to consult. She has seen her PCP, and he has not offered any explanations or solutions. She is on the following medications, Prednisone, Crestor, Levothyroxine, Hydrochlorothiazide, also Insulin for type 2 diabetes. A blood test that was taken five years ago revealed that she had a biopsy done, and they said there were suggestive findings of giant cell arteritis. They did think it was the Prednisone she was taking but have lowered her dosage from 30 mg a day to 10 mg a day. I need a guide as to what my next step should be.","Hi,Welcome to icliniq.com. I have reviewed your query, and here is my suggestion. She is taking Prednisolone which can induce abnormal behavior in the long term. The features you mentioned above are suggestive of mental illness. I suggest it would be better to visit a nearby psychiatrist for a proper assessment. Ask her to reduce doses of Prednisolone slowly. Do not worry after starting treatment with antipsychotics, she will become completely normal within a week. CT computed tomography scan of the brain is also required to rule out other causes.Hope I have answered your question.

"Hello doctor,
I am pursuing a postgraduate degree at an institute and have been married for seven years. Unfortunately, I am living apart from my wife and children. Due to specific issues, I started my PG course a decade later than my peers. While I can finally pursue it, separation from my kids has affected my emotional well-being. This sadness has started to impact my work, causing me to fall behind my younger peers by 7 to 10 years. Consequently, my confidence level has significantly decreased.
To address my concerns, I sought help from a psychiatrist who prescribed me Paroxetine and Propranolol. However, apart from Propranolol, the prescribed medication did not provide me with the desired relief. Subsequently, I took it upon myself to try Fluoxetine and later Escitalopram, which provided some relief but inconsistently. There were moments when I felt confident, while at other times, I experienced anxiety, helplessness, and low confidence.
The main issue that has led me to seek assistance here is extreme shyness and discomfort around women. As an introvert, I have never been at ease around females, but the problem has escalated tremendously. I feel incredibly timid in their presence and struggle to maintain eye contact. As a result, I avoid eye contact altogether, which unintentionally gives the impression that I am flirting with them. This behavior persists regardless of the persons appearance or age, ranging from teenagers to elderly women. To my dismay, some of my female teachers, above 50, mistakenly believe I am infatuated with them. This situation feels entirely out of my control, and the antidepressants I take only seem to worsen it. Apart from this particular issue, I generally function well and can handle most aspects of my life, except for these challenges in interacting with women. I feel utterly helpless in this regard.
I even experimented with Modafinil, but it yielded no significant improvements. My fear of interacting with women, or gynophobia, tends to intensify during the early morning and evening hours. I typically take Escitalopram in the morning or at night and Modafinil in the morning or evening.
When Escitalopram or Modafinil provide some relief, I can confidently engage with women. However, these instances are few and far between, and I often find myself disadvantaged in female interactions. As a doctor, I am expected to be comfortable around my female colleagues, just like my male friends are. Unfortunately, this is not the case for me, and I am concerned about their negative image of me and perceiving me as a pervert despite being a married man.
I desperately seek advice on overcoming this internal struggle affecting my interactions with women. Please, I need your help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq family,
Thank you for reaching out and sharing your concerns about female phobia and anxiety. I understand that you have already tried various medications, and I would like to offer some suggestions to help you address these challenges
It would be beneficial to undergo a complete thyroid profile to rule out any underlying thyroid issues that may contribute to your symptoms.
Continue taking Propranolol 40 mg, as it has provided some relief for you.
Instead of the previous antidepressants, I recommend considering Vilazodone 40 mg. Discuss this option with your doctor to see if it might be a suitable alternative for you.
Behavioral therapy, provided by a skilled psychologist, can be immensely helpful in addressing your phobia and anxiety. I encourage you to seek professional guidance in this area.
Remember that your difficulties are temporary and will likely improve with time, especially once you complete your PG course. Remind yourself of this and try to stay positive.
Since you are experiencing adjustment problems while living away from your family, consider visiting them frequently or inviting them to visit you. Maintaining a connection with your loved ones can provide emotional support and a sense of comfort.
It is essential to avoid frequently changing medications. I recommend sticking with Vilazodone for at least 12 months to allow sufficient time to take effect. It is advisable to discontinue the use of Modafinil.
I hope these suggestions prove helpful to you. If you have any further doubts or questions, please feel free to ask.
Take care and best regards.","{'score': 86, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 5, 'transparency': 8}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello,
I am 23-year-old and have the white dead skin on the edges of my tongue. I brush my teeth daily, and there is no pain. However, I have had it for a couple of years. How could I get rid of it?","Hi, Welcome to icliniq.com.
I read your query and understand your concern. I empathize with your concerns about the dead skin patch on the lateral tongue border. I have examined the picture attachments removed to protect the patients identity. Please answer a few questions- Did you ever go to the dentist and get this patch examined before? Have you undergone any dental treatment before? I need your dental history if you would elaborate on it a bit. This can happen for several reasons that cause the tongue epithelium or skin to become thickened. It might be due to a weak immune system, rarely some forms of precancerous lesions that are pretty harmless unless provoked, vitamin deficiencies, and smokers and alcoholics. I suggest you to give me your dental history first so I can formulate an exact treatment plan for the non-surgical elimination of this white lesion. Simple strategies that I can suggest you to reduce the thickened patch are as follows- You must use lukewarm salt water rinsing six to seven times a day and You can use Chlorhexidine Gluconate 0.2  mouthwash every night for three months. You can also apply Choline Salicylate gel with Lidocaine 2  gel combination for 15 days on the lesion.

I recently got an EBV test done. My result was IgG positive and IgM negative. What does this mean? Is it life-threatening, like HIV? Is it contagious? Please guide","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com. IgM immunoglobulin M negative and IgG immunoglobulin G positive means that you do not have an acute infection but may be a carrier of Epstein-Barr virus EBV which is not as dangerous as HIV human immunodeficiency virus and can be easily treated. You may develop symptoms of sore throat, swollen glands, fever, rashes, abdominal pain, cough, and runny nose. Symptoms generally last for between a week and a month, although they can recur when the body is under stress. EBV is contagious and spreads via saliva, often through kissing, sharing of drinks, eating utensils, toys, towels, etc. Treatment in children includes rest and plenty of fluids. Painkillers are usually prescribed to relieve fever and pain. If there is extensive swelling of the throat or glands which compromise breathing, then steroids may be given.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

You should exercise daily for 30 to 45 minutes like at least going for a walk.

You should eat healthy home-cooked foods and avoid junk foods.
You must drink enough water.
You should spend quality time with friends and family members daily.
You should spend time doing creative hobbies like reading good books, writing journals, painting, drawing, and learning new skills or language or musical instruments.
You should sleep for seven to eight hours daily.
You must avoid tobacco usage, alcohol consumption, or any type of substance abuse.

"Hello doctor,My fiance had surgery on a tibia or fibula fracture one week ago and has had his pain controlled by Norco. His pain at the site of the break has been well controlled, but throughout the week, he has complained more and more of knee pain. His knee is bruised, extremely swollen, and obviously deformed compared to his other leg. The pain has gotten so bad that he can no longer move his leg or even get out of bed. The surgeon said there were no complications in the surgery. They put a rod in his tibia and plated his fibula and when we called the after-hours number they said this was normal. But it is not normal. He says it feels like his kneecap is dislocated. What do we do? Please help.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Knee pain can be due to the following causes-
1. Initial injury causing sprain or torn ligaments.
2. The rod can also cause knee irritation if its too prominent.
3. It can be a reactive synovitis to the injury or surgery which will settle, However, to differentiate from these I need to see the knee X-rays, So upload the X-rays, pre and post-operative.

"Hello doctor,
I am a 32-year-old male. I am having chronic idiopathic pancreatitis. I am regularly on Agna 25000 three times, and Cretox CP three times a day.My problem are cold and cough for two years approximately. Almost four to five days a week. Even sleeping under the fan my nose gets blocked in the morning and nowadays I feel uncomfortable when dust is around as well. I did total IgE, and the report showed quite a high IgE value. Please diagnose and suggest medicine.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
We are happy to help you.
I understand that you have these complaints for a few years. It most probably is a manifestation of allergic rhinitis. The total IgE in serum is just an indication of the allergy status at the time of taking the blood sample. It is not very significant in allergy practice. Nevertheless, it shows that you have an allergy. You need some medicines to keep allergies under wraps and prevent blockages and colds. You also need to find out which allergen is offending and causing the problems. The best way to diagnose is by getting a skin prick test done at a good allergy diagnostic lab.
Meanwhile, you will be benefitted from an antihistaminic with Leukotriene inhibitor combination, steroid nasal spray, and allergen avoidance. You would need to be taking these for about two to three months. Allergen avoidance is the best solution. Could you provide us with more details about the complaints so that we can guide you better?
Is the problem seasonal or perennial? Does it only occur at night when you lie down under the fan or at any time of the day? Does it get worse in winter or when you visit any hill station? Where do you live? Do you smoke? What is your diet like? Do you get exposed to vehicular exhaust pollution or smoke and dust of any kind? Have you tried nasal sprays before? Is the cough wet or dry? Is there any breathing difficulty or wheezing? Is there any change of voice?","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 93, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}"

"Hello doctor,
My last period was on the 3rd of last month. Immediately, the next day, I had unprotected sex but I took a pill the next day. Later after one week i .e, on the 11th I experienced spotting. I am worried about whether I am pregnant. Now I am expecting my regular cycle but I am late for my periods by three days. Please help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Based on the details you provided, if you had your periods started on 3rd, then effectively 4th is usually a safe period. So chances of pregnancy are usually less for any intercourse during your menstrual cycle, but very rarely it can happen too. I would also like to tell you that the emergency contraceptive pills contain high dose of progesterone hormones, which can cause disturbances in the menstrual patterns. Some may have immediate withdrawal within few days and some may have delayed periods also. So if your cycles had been previously regular always, and you have a delay of three days from the expected time period, it would be imperative to check your urine pregnancy test once. If that is negative, then you can rest assured that you are not pregnant, and if there has been no other intercourse after 4th, it is highly unlikely that you may turn positive at a later date.  It will be a more objective test and relieve you of your stress.
As per your menses, if the pregnancy test is delayed, it may take a while because of the i-pill, so you can just wait for another one or two weeks, mostly you will be getting your periods by then. I would also like to advise you to use a more consistent contraceptive method like condoms or regular contraceptive pills in the future, which are more reliable and do not cause disruption of your hormonal balance as repeated i-pill intake can take a toll on your menstrual pattern.

"Hello doctor,My baby is 4 years old. She is passing urine frequently. During the night, every hour she passes urine, and her sleep gets disturbed. What should I do about this?Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to iclinq.com.
Frequent urination in a 4-year-old child can have several possible causes, including urinary tract infections, diabetes, or even excessive fluid intake. It is important to consult with your childs pediatrician to determine the underlying cause and receive appropriate advice and treatment. However, here are a few general suggestions that may help in the meantime
Ensure proper hydration. Make sure your child is drinking enough fluids during the day. Encourage regular water intake but avoid excessive consumption close to bedtime.
Monitor fluid intake. Keep track of the number of fluids your child is consuming throughout the day. If you notice theyre drinking a large quantity in the evening, try to limit it to a few hours before bedtime.
Bathroom schedule. Establish a regular bathroom schedule for your child, including before bedtime. Encourage them to empty their bladder completely before going to sleep.
Limit caffeine and sugar. Avoid giving your child drinks or foods that contain caffeine or excessive sugar, as these can increase urine production and frequency.
Evaluate diet. Certain foods and beverages, such as citrus fruits, spicy foods, and acidic foods, can irritate the bladder. Monitor your childs diet to see if any particular items are causing increased urination.
Check for UTI urinary tract infection symptoms. Keep an eye out for other symptoms of a urinary tract infection, such as pain or burning during urination, fever, or unusual odor in the urine. If you suspect a UTI, consult a healthcare professional.
Remember, it is important to consult with your childs pediatrician to discuss the issue in detail and receive appropriate medical advice tailored to your childs specific situation. They can conduct a thorough evaluation and recommend further tests or treatments if necessary.

If the sugar level is controlled and you take Aspirin regularly, it can be managed with tablets. If the pain worsens, you can go for stenting. In my opinion, no need for open heart surgery.

Now, I have stopped it as adviced by the doctor. Still, he gets wheezing minimum one time a month and a maximum of three times during winter. He also gets wheezing whenever he has a throat infection.
The allergy test was done and the doctor said my son does not have an allergy. Primary complex test Mantoux test proved positive but the doctor also looked at the chest X-ray and enquired about family history no smokers, vegetarians, non-alcoholics. So she asked us to wait.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Generally, we would label your son a recurrent wheezer at this age. Asthma is not a diagnosis of the tender age. Wheezing is generally associated with allergy and not always can be found with a blood test. It can be an allergy to dust, pollution, dampness, pets or anything. Sometimes, we use Montelukast for a long duration to modify the wheezing condition. Ask your doctor for the same. Giving an annual flu vaccine also helps. Mantoux test is a non-specific test and does not confirm tuberculosis. Other investigations are performed in addition to the Mantoux test to confirm TB.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 91, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"

With the list of symptoms mentioned, it appears to be due to worm infestation. Any abdominal pain? Restless sleep? Irritable? Did you notice white thread-like worms in the potty? Does she eat mud? Any other family member having a similar complaint? Well do this, examine the anal area around the anus in the night two hours after she goes to sleep. Pinworms usually come out of the anus during the night. This is only for confirmation. Always needs to be confirmed whether we are treating the cause as there are many ailments that need to be ruled out for unintentional weight loss. Treatment includes a single dose of tablet Albendazole 400 mg to be taken by all the family members irrespective of symptoms at once. If she has severe itching apply lotion Caladryl in and around itchy areas.
Now the most important aspect, prevention
Wash her or bathe her immediately as she gets up, as this gets rid of the eggs that have stuck to her butt area with hot water.
Change her underwear and bed linens every day.
Trim her nails every alternate day.
Not to scratch.
No nail biting.
Wash her and your hands frequently.

Please remember whether you have eaten something that explains these symptoms particularly diet or beverage rich in fructose, sugar, or milk protein. Milkshakes, juices, alcohol, and raw vegetables or salads often cause excessive belching.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
There are many reasons for this condition, so you need to be evaluated and physical examination is required.
For managing ED erectile dysfunction, a drug like Sildenafil or Tadalafil are the first-line treatment. Sildenafil can be started from 50 mg for almost half an hour before the sexual activity. Similarly, Tadalafil 10 mg can be used. The effects of Sildenafil last for one day while Tadalafil lasts for three days.
For managing Premature ejaculation, a drug from SSRI selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor group such as Fluoxetine or Sertraline or Dapoxetine is used. Fluoxetine 20 mg daily or Sertraline 50 mg daily or Dapoxetine 30 mg can be taken one hour before the sexual activity. There is a combination of Dapoxetine and Sildenafil available in the market that can be used one hour before the sexual activity. Maintain a healthy lifestyle, take healthy food, avoid substance abuse and do regular exercise.

"Hello doctor,
I was affected by the Coronavirus three months back and lost my smell and some of my taste. I retested, and my results came back negative. I still cannot smell after three months, and I wondered if any medication could reverse my anosmia.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Thanks for briefing regarding the problem in concern. This is perfectly normal as 70 percent of patients who have been found COVID-19 positive have coincidently had complaints of anosmia loss of sense of smell and altered sense of taste dysgeusia. The loss of smell and taste is sudden in 80 percent, while it is gradual in the rest. The virus attacks the olfactory receptors in the skull base, not allowing smell processing and effective transmission to occur. This results in a loss of perception of smell. The smell and taste processing areas are very closely located in the brain and work together. If there is less processing of smell, the taste perception also comes down, and that why you might initially have altered perception of taste and then complete loss. Some of the immunocompetent patients had other complaints such as headaches, weakness, fever, etc., associated as well, while some have only loss of smell and taste. It might take approximately around four months on average to get 50 percent of both smell and taste function back with what I have observed. This time duration might vary, and for now, there is nothing that you need to do, not worry. There is no time tested medication to bring back the function of taste and smell quickly and effectively. I am sure both the perception of smell and taste will improve over time, and you will be entirely back to normal. If there is anything that you want to know or enquire about, please do let me know.

To answer, let me explain to you how a nerve grows. It takes one month of latency and later nerve grows at 1 mm per day. Even though the nerve might reach your muscle, for bulk to improve, it takes another few months. For one to determine if the nerve signals have improved, you can get an electromyography to see for any improvement. Decompression will improve sensation very fast and then power. But for muscle bulk, it usually takes a while for muscle transfer to be suitable. In case, you have any form of weakness and never to fill up a cosmetic defect such as hypothenar flatness, for that one can consider fat grafting. If the bulk does not improve after six months. I would advise you to wait as it usually takes longer than 14 weeks. If you want to see and have proof of progress go for EMG.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have read your query but it is not very clear. You have not mentioned how many times you masturbate or if it is causing problems other than psychological, and the exact nature of these psychological issues. However, I will address the last part directly where you feel the urge or acting on the urge causes you to lose focus. You can try the following
1. Divide your day into hours given over to all activities and then try to stay within the allotted time for each this includes meal times, time allotted for bathroom breaks and masturbation along with different subjects.
2. Do not forget to allot yourself free time to pursue whatever you want even if it 30 minutes per day.
3. If you feel the urge during a time allotted for another activity, it means you have lost focus so shift to another activity and then get back to the remaining time for the former.
4. Try to incorporate exercise in your schedule, endorphins are released in both so that might distract you as well.
5. Last but not least, you do need therapy to figure out which issues bother you anal masturbation, masturbation in any form, excessive masturbation or your inability to concentrate. This can be provided by a school or college counselor as a start if you cannot contact a psychiatrist or psychologist.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Rightly said, withdrawal is not an effective method. As the precum or pre-seminal fluid the clear fluid that comes out before the semen is rich in active with healthy sperms, it can be enough for you to get pregnant. I cannot tell you conclusively if that was an implantation bleeding as it is variable in different people. In some, it may just a few drops of bright blood or dark, thick blood or brown blood or like regular periods like bleeding or nothing at all.
Vitamin C in no way can stop periods or alter the bleeding pattern. Now the only way to know is to have home urine pregnancy test within next two to four days with the first urine sample in the morning. It will detect pregnancy as early as one day after missed periods. If doubtful or for confirmation you can also do blood serum beta hCG human chorionic gonadotropin. It can detect the smallest of pregnancy even those missed by the urine test, anywhere in the body. Think positively, just wish to get periods tomorrow. If need arises have urine tested and be confident to see only that single line, which means you are not pregnant. This stress itself can delay your periods. So just keep calm as there is a solution for everything. All the best.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 7, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Your workup has to be done as follow Auscultation, posterior pharynx examination, CBC complete blood count. If throat congestion is present than decongestant like Levocetirizine can be prescribed for that. For dyspnea, CBC will rule out anemia if present and it will also help in abnormal respiratory sound if present. Then, if needed after auscultation, further workup done in form of chest X-ray. Abdominal pain could be from viral gastritis and Pantoprazole can be prescribed for that. But consult the nearby physician for examination as difficult breathing also present.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Sudden retention of urine in a female may be due to infection. A rare cause is Fowlers syndrome. Give hot fomentation in the lower abdomen below the umbilicus. If you feel like you need to pass urine, go to the toilet and open the tap. Let the cold water touch your feet. It is one of the methods to relieve retention. If everything fails, then you may need catheterization by a doctor.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 81, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 8}"

Take oral antibiotics to prevent infection in the wound like Zifi Cefixime 200 twice daily for three days.
Take some oral painkillers like Ibuprofen or Paracetamol to reduce the inflammation and pain.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
It looks like you have a huge epithelial defect due to trauma caused by contact lenses. But the possibility of infection can only be ruled out by examining your eye. It would have been great if you would have attached a photograph but, let me suggest some medication that will cover both the defect and infection, if present. So I suggest you to take the medications. Take Carboxymethylcellulose eye lubricant 1  eye drop 10 to 12 times per day, HPMC Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose eye ointment twice daily ,Moxifloxacin antibiotic eye drops six times a day ,Tobramycin Aminoglycoside antibiotic eye drops four times a day, Homatropine anticholinergic eye drops once at bedtime will cause blurred vision especially for near, Polymyxin antibiotic eye ointment at bedtime. Discontinue contact lenses for two months. If no relief is obtained in a couple of days, then visit an ophthalmologist.

"Hello doctor,I am a 26-year-old woman. Four months ago, I experienced vaginal itching and burning. I consulted a doctor and applied Ketoconazole ointment for 10 days, which completely resolved the issue. However, after stopping the ointment for 10 days, the itching returned. When I reapplied the same ointment, it did not work for me. So, I visited my gynecologist again. She prescribed Itraconazole 200 mg for 10 days and Clotrimazole 1 cream.

After not using the cream for five days, when I started using it again, I did not experience any relief, and it actually worsened the symptoms. So, I consulted my gynecologist once more. She prescribed some antibiotics and antifungal suppositories to insert into the vagina, and she recommended applying Luliconazole 1 cream. I followed her advice, took the antibiotics, inserted the vaginal suppositories, and applied the cream twice a day for the past week. I also took a Fluconazole tablet.

Welcome to icliniq.com.

Giving a detailed diet chart without understanding your dietary preferences and daily routine is difficult.
I will advise you on some tips that you need to follow regularly. You will succeed in losing fat.
1. Start your day with a half litre of warm water followed by eight to ten soaked almonds and raisins. Never start your day with tea or coffee.
2. A simple exercise like walking or light aerobics should ideally follow this. If you enjoy gym training, you can go for it. Some form of exercise is necessary. You must do at least 45 minutes at one stretch of simple exercises five days a week.
3. Eat all your meals at a set time, and let your body understand when exactly you are feeding them.
4. Eat a healthy snack in between your major meals. Choose among the following - a handful of peanuts or any other raw nuts or dry fruits, a bowl of sprouts, or any fruit.
5. Drink at least three litres of water daily.
6. Sleep and wake up at the same time every day.
7. Reduce oily food and sweets intake to just one piece a week.
8. All sugary drinks and sodas are a big no.
9. Finish your last meal at least two hours before bed.
Follow these tips, and you will see a change within the next one month.

"Hello doctor,
I am a 30-year-old woman with three kids with C-sections, so I want to know whether I can have more kids naturally.
Thanking you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern.
You can definitely have one more pregnancy. No matter how many kids you have, you can have more naturally without treatment. But as you will have to deliver by planned cesarean section. After the second C-Section, you can never have a normal delivery. After the second C-section, the scar on the uterus is not as strong as the first C-section scar. So it will be weaker after the third C-section.
But you can have a fourth baby. Certain precautions to be taken
1. Scan to confirm the normal rate of growth of the baby.
2. Location of the placenta in relation to the scan, any penetration into the scar.
3. Ensure your blood hemoglobin level is always well maintained.
4. Keep a suitable blood donor for any emergency.
5. Avoid any infection throughout pregnancy. pain and cause the uterus to contract and a scar can also give way to infection.
6. Have an early admission for a planned C-section.
Preferably have sterilization also with the next C-section. Any further pregnancy will surely affect the health of the scar and can give way anytime.
I hope I have cleared your query.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I went through your query.
The difference between MAFLD metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is that MAFLD is not caused by alcohol but rather simply due to the derailment of the level of the electrolytes in the body that manifests a liver disease while alcohol fatty liver is mainly caused by alcoholic ingestion.
The recommended treatment for MAFLD is to take adequate drug supplements and eat a lot of fruits and vegetables to maintain the electrolytes.

"Hello doctor,
I am suffering from pain while passing stools and there are some blood spots on the stool. The pain is unbearable but there is no swelling as such. I am unable to go out due to the lockdown situation. Please guide me on what to do. Is this normal? I am a diabetic.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your condition. You say you are  having bloodstained stools and there is no swelling in the anal region which is a good sign.
Now based on your history, I suspect you must have had constipation a couple of times. Constipation ultimately will lead to hard stools which can cause a tear at the anal region. I also guess that you are having a fissure in the anal region i.e. a tear at the anal verge. And since it is painful and recent, it is of acute nature.
I suggest you consume a high fiber diet. Regarding treatment, you have to sit in a tub filled warm water twice daily for five to ten minutes for ten days. It is advisable to put in 5-10 ml of Betadine solution, but if you are not able to go out due to lockdown you can use it as plain warm water. This process is called as sitz bath.
If you can get to a pharmacy get an ointment Lidocaine 5. Apply it thrice a day at the anal verge better to apply before and after defecation. Avoid straining and avoid constipation by including green leafy veggies in your diet and drink plenty of water.

There could be the following reasons for an erection problemOngoing anxiety and depression The proper treatment of anxiety and depression will rectify this issue.
Panazep Paroxetine is known to cause sexual dysfunction. In case your problem began after starting Panazep, then replacing it with some other safer medication is advisable.
As there is a low desire in addition to an erection problem, it is advisable to get a serum testosterone and a serum prolactin level done from a near by laboratory. In case there is any abnormality, it should be corrected.As you can see, the medication depends on the underlying cause and there is no single drug which will work in every condition.I request you to get the above mentioned hormonal levels checked and report back to me. For an interim relief, it is advisable to continue Sildenafil 25 mg as the chances of side effects are much less with a low dose.I hope this helps you.

"Hello doctor,
I am contacting you regarding some symptoms I have been having lately. I am a 30-year-old male. I take no medication. My height is 181 cm, my weight is 133 kg, and I am generally overall healthy.
Before one and half years, I had several episodes of muscle twitching. The muscle twitching was spontaneous and seen in random parts of the body. One day, my left upper forearm could twitch for a couple of hours and then disappear. Then five days later, my right thumb could twitch intermittently for some minutes or hours and disappear again. After that, my shoulder muscles could twitch with the same frequency and disappear. The frequency was very intermittent so that the episodes could last all from 15 mins to four or five days. The twitching would switch places, so for some period, it could be my right leg muscles, and another period could be my face, like eyebrows, cheeks, and arms or hands or fingers. So it was never really localized in a particular area in my body. It was seen at random places.
I talked with a doctor at that time, and the doctor told me not to worry as this most likely could be because of stress or anxiety. And for the past year, the twitching disappeared completely. But I noticed some weird things in the toes of both of my legs. Sometimes whenever I lift my left leg and place it on my right knee when sitting, the toes of my leg very subtly contract. This also happens at random and does not happen on all movements. If I were to estimate, it only occurs 5 to 10  of the time of each movement related to my left leg. The contraction of the toes happens very fast.","Hello,

I would like a query about hand surgery and hand tumors. My moms hand had a lump near her wrist which she did not care about. One day while cleaning the house, she pulled her hand and hurt herself in a safe area. But she did not go to a doctor because she said she did not have any pain and she could use her hand properly. After two months, we forced her to go to the doctor. The hand was not broken, but she could not use it or carry things. The doctor suspected cancer, but the tests were negative, and it turned out to be a tumor. My mom underwent an operation where they removed the tumor. The doctor informed us that he would have to do a bone graft so he could fill the hole in her hand because they had to remove some parts of the bone that were infected. Three months after the operation, she went to see the doctor again, who told her to do some X-rays and informed her that a few small tumors had returned which required the amputation of her hand to stop them from growing. We are confused as initially they told us she does not have cancer, so why do they need to remove her hand now? I want a second opinion.","Hello,

I am really sorry for your mother. I have seen the picture you sent and read the report attachment removed to protect the patients identity. As it shows the evidence of recurrence of the tumor, the best option for her is removing the tumor. However, you did not send the histopathology report to determine if the tumor is benign or malignant in nature. It is because the treatment is dependent on the nature of the tumor.

I did something very silly 10 days ago. I was outside all day without a sunscreen, so the tops of my breasts were exposed to the sun until 200 PM. I got a sunburn which is typical, as my skin type makes me prone to it. Usually, it subsides within a week, if not less. However, this time the tops of my breasts are still red in splotches, with a seemingly brown vein of skin running through them. They are sensitive, and sometimes bleed if accidentally poked with a brush, which has never happened before. I have been applying Neosporin to them at least three times a day. I will try to upload photos. Can you possibly help or recommend a treatment path?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
It seems you developed severe sunburn. Sunburn is a clinical reaction due to the acute effects of the suns ultraviolet radiation UVR on the skin. I suggest using normal saline or 110,000 dilution potassium permanganate compresses or soaks to wash away serous discharge, crust, and debris. It will help reduce oozing and inflammation. Use a combination of Mometasone cream and Fusidic acid cream twice daily. In your case, a systemic steroid may need to be administered orally. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her, and start taking medicine immediately.","{'score': 86, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 8}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 85, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 9}"

"Hello doctor,My mother has fluid discharge from the ear. What could be the reason?Kindly help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Thanks for your query.
The history you give is suggestive of a chronic infection of the middle ear. Does she also feel a drop in the hearing? Middle ear infections present usually with ear discharge. Blood from the ear may be due to infection or due to trauma to the ear. Your mother needs to get a physical examination of the ears to see if there is any hole in the eardrum. She will need further hearing testing and other tests based on the ear findings. In the meantime ensure that water does not enter the ear.
Hope this helps.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 96, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,
I have been suffering from allergies for the past four days. I have been using Keto 4S cream thrice daily, Candiforce 200 mg once every two days after food, and Levocetirizine daily at night after dinner. Even after taking these medications, I have not observed any changes. Kindly help. Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Thank you for your query. I reviewed your history and image attachment removed to protect patients identity. The most likely possibility of the skin condition is post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, also presented as lichen planus. Unfortunately, the history provided from your end is insufficient. Therefore, I request you to give a few more details. What are the symptoms associated with the lesions? Was the current medication prescribed by a doctor after the consultation? Did you notice any change in the appearance of the lesion? Any family history of similar lesions? The current medications, as you have mentioned in the history, are for the treatment of tinea infections which are fungal infections. In the case of tinea, the medicines need to be used for at least eight weeks to notice changes and reduce symptoms and intensity of lesions. Keto 4S cream, as mentioned, when used on tinea infections, would not show changes as it is a combination cream with ingredients contradicting the treatment of tinea, which may result in a flare-up of the current condition. Therefore, I would suggest you to stop the medications for three days and undergo the following before starting the treatment, depending on the report. KOH potassium hydroxide skin scraping test, where the skin scalings are scraped gently and tested to see the presence of fungal elements. In the absence of fungal elements, the current medication would not show changes, requiring a change of the current treatment. I suggest CBC complete blood count, ESR erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and CRP c-reactive protein tests be done to rule out the presence of allergic reactions and the presence of recent infections or inflammatory responses within the body. Kindly follow up with the above details. I hope this has helped you.

The feeling of symptoms like periods but not actually having bleeding could be due to ovulation pain, what is called in medical terms is Mittelschmerz pain. If your cycles are ovulatory, all the more good. Try for conception in the middle of your cycle days, say in  25-28 day cycle 8-18 days. Do not worry if three months are gone. Give a fair trial for six months before undergoing any investigations. Folic acid to continue till you conceive.

"Hi doctor,
I am a bit nervous. Someone took a sip from my glass two days ago. The next day, this person had blisters around their mouth. So I am terrified I will get herpes. However, I still have not experienced any blisters, tingling, or burning sensations around my lips.
Nevertheless, I am scared that I have got herpes. Is it possible that I have it despite the fact that I have no symptoms around my lips? What are these possibilities?

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern.
Based on the information provided, your worries look legitimate yet slightly accurate. In my opinion, it is normal to be afraid of the herpes simplex virus a virus causing contagious sores, most often around the mouth or on the genitals blisters because the condition is infectious, but this does not indicate that it spreads quickly. Even if your drink was contaminated, the odds of it spreading are quite low since we require an infective dosage of the virus, which is often not possible with such exposure. The concept of genital herpes is based entirely on fear rather than actual risk. Because you had no direct contact with the person, the chances of herpes spreading to the genital area are extremely minimal.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

I started getting acne at 23. Before that, I had perfect skin. I do not have PCOS, and I am not taking any birth control pills. My skin is also very sensitive. Even natural products like tomato breaks me out. I took Doxycycline for two months, but it did not help. Please help.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have seen your query and concern.
Please get a review with a picture, if possible, for better evaluation. Firstly, you need to consult a dermatologist nearby to assess the grade and severity of acne or get a review with pictures. If acne is mild, then topical anti-acne creams like Clindamycin, Adapalene, etc., will help. If acne is severe, then oral medicines like Azithromycin or Doxycycline with or without Isotretinoin should be started along with anti-acne creams.
Following are some of the general treatment measures
1. Use a face wash for oily skin like Ahaglow Acrylate copolymer and sodium laureth sulfate or Cetaphil sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, sodium laureth sulfate, and butylene glycol as a cleanser to wash your face.
2. Apply Clindamycin gel in the morning and Adapalene gel at night over the acne lesions.
3. If you have blackheads or whiteheads, get these removed.
4. Avoid squeezing pimples as it will leave a mark.
Follow these above measures for two weeks to see how much response you get. If the acne is of mild grade, then it will respond. But if it is of severe grade, then oral medicine will be required.
Hope this helps.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern. Fungal infection indeed is a very problematic condition if it becomes recurrent. I suggest you take the following precautions -
Do not keep the area wet and use powder frequently to dry it.
Do not scratch it.
Do not apply steroid creams like Betnovate Betamethasone Valerate.
Do not stop the medications once it is cured instead continue it for a long time to completely kill the infection.
Avoid sweating.
Change the undergarments frequently.
Check for diabetes and thyroid if the infection recurs even after the completion of treatment.
I suggest you take any of the combinations of the following medications -
Cream Ketoconazole and tablet Terbinafine 250 mg for 2 months.
Cream Terbinafine and tablet Fluconazole 150 mg twice a week for 2 months.
Tablet Itraconazole 200 mg once a day along with any cream for 1 month.
Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with them, and take the medicines with their consent.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I read your query and can understand your concern.
There appears to be some residual tissue in your womb following your original abortion operation, which is why you were offered a second treatment. Heavy bleeding and the passage of substantial blood clots are not unusual during this phase. However, because it has been over two weeks since the second treatment and you are still suffering significant bleeding and passing huge blood clots, you must undergo an ultrasound of the entire abdomen and report back to me or the gynecologist. Meanwhile, you should care for yourself by resting, being hydrated, and monitoring your symptoms. If you experience severe pain or excessive bleeding that saturates more than one pad per hour or feel lightheaded or dizzy, please seek immediate medical attention, as these could be signs of a complication.

I read your query and understand your concern. Sometimes slight bleeding or spotting could occur during ovulation and it is normal, but if the bleeding is heavy then you should consult a gynecologist.

"Hi doctor,
I am a 21 years old. I have been suffering from frequent urination. I have never experienced bladder problems before. However, I do suffer from severe period pains. Is there any relation between the two? From the last few months, I have to pee very frequently. I was working a lot when this all started, so it was not too bad, as I was constantly busy and I had no time to think about it. I also feel as though it was not as bad as it is now. I am now unemployed, so I have a lot more spare time, so I do not know if this is a psychological thing, which is making me feel like it is worse.I constantly feel the pressure in my bladder to pee, and I feel it significantly when lying down. If I take a nap at any point or if I lay down, the pressure on my bladder is insane. Even if I go to the toilet, I feel the need to go again straight after. I have been to my doctor recently, and I explained my symptoms. He prescribed Trimethoprim, which I have been taking for three days now. I feel uneasy, as the doctor said this antibiotic normally works in two days. I am going to remain positive and do my full seven-day course. I have also given a sample of my urine to be tested, and I have also booked a blood test for tomorrow morning. I have been fasting recently, so the dizziness and dehydration are expected.
I have been holding back on drinking water, as I fear this will make it worse. So, I drink two glasses of water maximum a day.

You should understand the difference between depression and disappointment. Disappointment also manifest symptoms as in the case of the depression.Were you deeply disappointed in the near past, say within one year? You did not have any bad experiences and your family does not have any depression history.  That is perfect. You feel, numb, sad and worthless.  Feeling irritable and spending more time alone. These are some of depression symptoms, but your problem is never depression. From the given symptoms,  I see this as an attitude problem related to some sort of disappointment. You are just 19. I suggest you forcefully change your habit. Do not be alone. Be with family members or friends. If you do not have friends, then make friends. Go outside and socialize. Engage in physical activities and outdoor or indoor games. You will have many things to study. Do it. Divert your attention to more productive, creative and positive things rather than brooding yourself worthlessly. I do not see depression now. If you continue the present attitude and behavior further, then it could lead to depressive disorder.  Please do compulsively as I advised.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
According to your statement, you have been suffering from stomach bloating and acidity. It is better to take Simethicone after meals and Omeprazole before a meal or empty stomach. But you can take both Simethicone and Omeprazole together. This is because there are no interactions found between Omeprazole and Simethicone. So, you can take Omeprazole after taking Simethicone.
Similarly, there are no interactions found between Omeprazole and Benadryl Diphenhydramine. So, Benadryl can be taken along with Omeprazole. But it is said that if Benadryl is used regularly, it may worsen the symptoms of GERD gastroesophageal reflux disease like stomach bloating, indigestion, abdominal pain, acidity, etc. So, do not use Benadryl regularly. That may be harmful. Otherwise, you can take Benadryl along with Omeprazole or after Omeprazole.

The numbness you are feeling is because of transient mandibular nerve palsy, which is the most common complication of the inferior alveolar nerve block. So, do not panic.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
First of all, there are no readily available blood tests for genital herpes, and most often, a clinical examination is enough to confirm it. This is a painful blister, and a possible cause is a genital herpes, with a previous history of urine infection for which you are taking treatment. There are some general guidelines regarding genital herpes that you need to follow
Avoid excessive heat or sunlight, as it makes the irritation worse.
Do not use perfumed or antibacterial soaps, feminine deodorants, or douches.
Try to wear loose-fitting cotton clothes.
You can take some pain killer if required. If helpful, I suggest taking Acetaminophen Tylenol or Ibuprofen Advil, Motrin, and Nuprin.
Use a cold cloth on the affected area if it soothes the pain.
There is no treatment for this if you do not report very early. Antiviral medications can help manage the severity and the duration if taken immediately before an outbreak when there is tingling or an unusual skin sensation, but no blisters within 24 hours of an outbreak. That is to be taken after consulting your doctor, but it is rarely needed or prescribed. Lastly, this is an STD sexually transmitted disease, and thus, you need to get an STD profile screening to rule out other STDs as a cause. So, talk to your physician about it.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 82, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 9}"

I can understand your concern.
It would be better if you go for an HIV antibody test after 90 days of exposure rather than after 84 days to obtain conclusive results so that you can be relieved of anxiety totally. As per protocol better go after 90 days and be relieved of HIV worries totally. It includes both HIV 12 antibodies.
Antibiotics like amoxicillin are unlikely to affect HIV antibody test results. Please go for an HIV antibody test after 90 days of exposure in a reliable laboratory to obtain conclusive results.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,
I read that NSAIDs can cause heart failure. For the past four years, I have used NSAIDs but not regularly, which means I used it for a week whenever the doctor suggested. After that, I stopped taking it. I take it for two days, usually when I feel any pain. Will these affect in future? Is there any problem? What are the preventive measures?","Hi,

I understand your concern.
It is better to avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs. I suggest you find out the underlying cause of your pain and treat it. I hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

"Hi doctor,Today I came to know that there is a cavity in my last molar teeth. There is a pain in that area. Earlier I thought that it is because of new molar teeth coming out, but today I came to know about the cavity. I am afraid of needles, drilling and other stuff in dentistry. Please suggest some natural cure.","Hi,Welcome to icliniq.com.Unfortunately, there is no some magic cure for the cavities They cannot be cleaned and then refilled by themselves or through home remedies. You should take an appointment at earliest to your dentist and talk to him about your fear. He will deal it politely, you should not be scared. Get it filled else decay will increase and may cause root infection. Meanwhile, if it is paining, take some painkiller.As far as home remedy is concerned, it is clove. Bite clove and put it at the tooth that has a cavity, it will reduce pain, but that is a temporary solution. Also, you can apply clove oil. Put a few drops of clove oil at cotton and put it in the cavity. Stay happy and blessed. Good luck with the treatment.

"Hello doctor,
I suddenly experienced an upset stomach with just a semi-solid consistency of stool a few days back.

I have no pain while urinating. However, this sudden new symptom has caused me to be very anxious. I also have some PMS symptoms like muscle aches and so on. What to do?Please help.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Sometimes urine symptoms can happen whenever there is an altered stool pattern. If there is any problem in stool passage, it may reflect as a burning sensation or frequency of urine as the nerve supply to both areas is the same. In case there is no fever, and the stomach is still upset, you can start with a probiotic like Econorm sachet Saccharomyces boulardii twice a day for three days. If symptoms persist beyond two to three days, then get a urine routine test, an ultrasound KUB kidney, ureter, and bladder, and revert. A short course of antibiotics like Nitrofurantoin 100 mg twice a day for three days and Solifenacin 5 mg once a day for five days can be started after consultation with your general practitioner.
Hope it helps.

"Hello doctor,
I touched my girlfriends vagina and pre-ejaculated on my hands after 3 to 4 days of her period. Does this cause pregnancy?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I read your query and can understand your concern.
As per your description, these symptoms could be due to hormonal imbalance but it could be due to pregnancy also though the chances are very very low. But as you missed your period it could be an anovulatory cycle due to hormonal changes or due to pregnancy if precum contained sperm.
You should do a home urine pregnancy test after seven days of your missed period date or blood beta hCG human chorionic gonadotropin testing to rule out pregnancy right now. If pregnancy is not there, it could be due to hormonal imbalance and you can wait and watch for your menses, or can take progesterone for withdrawal bleeding. Get your thyroid profile and hemoglobin test also for any hormonal changes.
Hope found this useful, feel free to ask for more information.

"Hello doctor,
My sister is 32 years. After her second delivery, she got the problem of diffuse toxic goiter what is called Graves disease. She is on medication for the last six years. She is on Carbimazole. But, it is not effective as when she stopped taking the medicine she suffers again from the symptoms heart rate and sweating. The doctor advised her to get treatment by radioactive iodide. But she is worried this can lead to infertility. So, the other choice was to do a surgery to remove the thyroid gland. But, she will be on Thyroxine for the whole life. I wonder if this is the only choice she has. And, if this is the case, what is the best for her as she wants to get pregnant and she is breastfeeding now.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Graves disease treatment options are the following.
Medical therapy with drugs that she is already taking. The relapse rate is very high.
Radioiodine therapy which is the safest and easiest with least side effects. It does not cause infertility.
Surgery - as you said she will require lifelong Thyroxine replacement. Surgery is a complex procedure and is not preferred nowadays.
Therefore, radioiodine ablation is the best and easiest treatment.

"Hello doctor,I have had bleeding in my rectum and light vaginal bleeding for five days before my period. I am concerned about it. Please help.Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I can understand your concern.
According to your statement, you have been suffering from per rectal bleeding. Per rectal bleeding may be seen due to constipation, piles, fissures, hemorrhoids, and more. For per-rectal bleeding, you can take Lactulose to soften your stool and ease constipation. You can take Tranexamic acid to stop rectal bleeding. You should take plenty of green leafy vegetables and fluids to avoid constipation. Sometimes antibiotics may be needed for healing local inflammation, and a sitz bath may also be helpful. Taking Tranexamic acid also may help to stop your vaginal bleeding. Sometimes, light vaginal bleeding may be seen before starting your menstrual cycle. It can alsohappen for various reasons like urinary tract infection, pelvic inflammatory disease, endometriosis, cervical problems, renal stones, etc.
I would suggest you undergo some investigations like urine RME routine microscopic test, USG ultrasonography of the whole abdomen, VIA visual inspection with acetic acid test, colonoscopy or proctoscopy to find out the exact causes for both rectal and vaginal bleeding and do as needful according to the cause.
I hope this helps you.

Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand that frequent nighttime urination can be bothersome and disrupt your sleep. There are several potential reasons for this symptom, including
1. Nocturia This is a condition where individuals wake up at night to urinate more frequently than usual. It can be caused by various factors such as excessive fluid intake, urinary tract infections, bladder or prostate problems, or certain medications.
2. Overactive bladder This occurs when the muscles of the bladder contract involuntarily, causing a sudden and urgent need to urinate. Overactive bladder can result from various causes, including neurological conditions or irritation of the bladder lining.
3. Excessive fluid intake before bedtime Even if you do not feel like you drink a lot at night, you may consume more fluids during the day that contribute to nighttime urination.
To determine the underlying cause of your symptoms, it would be best to consult with a nearby doctor. They can evaluate your medical history, conduct a physical examination, and possibly order further tests, such as a urine analysis or bladder function tests if needed. In the meantime, here are a few suggestions that might help improve your symptoms
Limit your fluid intake in the evening, especially in the hours leading up to bedtime.
Avoid consuming caffeine or alcohol, as they can act as diuretics and increase urine production.
Empty your bladder fully before going to bed.
Practice relaxation techniques before sleep to help reduce stress or anxiety, as these can sometimes contribute to frequent urination.

I understand your concern. You have mild prostatitis. It is diagnosed clinically. The treatment consists of antibiotics, anti-inflammatory, and alpha-blockers. A urethral culture of the discharge is suggested however, the test does not always diagnose prostatitis. A semen culture can be done along with urethral discharge culture, and if found positive, specific antibiotics need to be started. Also, culture can be done even when you are on antibiotics. The symptoms of prostatitis get aggravated due to stress, lack of sleep, anxiety, and ejaculation.

"Hi doctor,I was infected by genital herpes three years back. Now I have reddish spots and rashes with itching skin and little tingling effects. The fungus can be noticed every morning when I woke up. My penile foreskin is tighter compared to before. Can you please help me out with this problem?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I hope you are doing well.
Having gone through the history provided and the images attachment removed to protect the patients identity provided from your end, it appears to be balanitis. Balanitis may be caused due to multiple reasons, including dryness as well as chapped skin, a condition termed eczema, fungal pathology, bacterial infections, psoriatic lesions, stress, changes in the climate, dietary factors, sweating, using any harsh chemicals and soaps or shampoos in cleaning the affected area, frequent trauma to the affected area and in case of other unknown causes which includes zoons balanitis.
Multiple medications are available to reduce the dryness and inflammation associated with balanitis. Still, they may require consistency with the application and intake of the medication to reduce the inflammation, which may take months to show complete recovery.
My advice
1. Terrasil Clotrimazole cream may be applied on the affected area in the morning daily for months together. They have antifungal and anti-drying properties, which help in hydration and prevent fungal infections in the affected area.
2. Fucidin H Fusidic Acid and Hydrocortisone Acetate cream may be applied in the smallest quantity as the thinnest layer on the affected area. This is a combination of corticosteroids and antibiotics, which are used to reduce inflammation and dryness formed on the affected area, along with preventing any secondary bacterial infections due to their antibacterial properties. Due to strong medication, the smallest quantity needs to be applied and may be continued for a maximum period of three weeks. Following this, they may be stopped for almost two weeks, after which they may be continued for two weeks, and so on.
3. Wick and Strom L- Arginine advanced penile moisturizing cream may be used to be applied on the affected area of the head of the penis once daily. They may be applied more than once daily because they have hydrating and moisturizing the area. In case of application more than once, it needs to be noted that the current creams, which are to be applied in the morning and at night, need to be applied first, and then following a waiting period of 30 minutes, this moisturizing cream may be applied on top of it.
4. Oilatum emollient Liquid Paraffin or bath formula, two caps full, which is available along with the bottle, may be mixed with one liter of normal temperature water, which can then be used for washing day affected area, which helps retain moisture as well as hydration. They may be used once daily.
5. Lukewarm salt water may also be used to soak and clean the area once daily. Lukewarm salt water, which is of sterile nature without any contaminants, may be applied to the affected area using cotton and kept for five to ten minutes before washing off daily. This is to reduce the itching or any symptoms along with anti-drying properties and in order to prevent any secondary bacterial infections.
6. Tablet Fluconazole 150 mg may be consumed orally as a single dose. They are to be taken as a single tablet after food today.
7. Since there are currently no signs of viral infection, the current medication, and creams, which are antivirals, may not be required.
8. Tablet Cetirizine 10 mg can be consumed in case of excess itching. This medication must be taken for a maximum period of two weeks and may also be continued later. This is to be taken after dinner one hour before going to sleep at night. This is helpful and reduces itching. Therefore, it is a sedative as well. Due to this reason, after consuming the tablet, it is not advised to go out or drive.
9. Capsule Omega 3 May also be consumed orally once daily after dinner in order to promote hydration of the affected area and may be continued for one month.
10. Avoid using harsh chemicals, soaps, or shampoos for washing the affected area, and make sure to clean and dry the area well after a bath and air the area well. Also, make sure to wear loose-fitting clothes in order to prevent further fungal infection.
11. Avoid oily and fried food, sweets, red meat, milk, dairy products, and spicy food, as they trigger the formation of infections. Instead, make sure to consume more fruits, vegetables, and proteins in the form of eggs and at least 13 glasses of water daily in a 250 ml glass size in order to provide hydration to your body.
Balanitis may be on and off depending upon the external as well as the internet triggers which have been mentioned above. Therefore, avoiding the external triggers and keeping the area moisturized, hydrated, and free of any secondary infections is key in order to manage the current inflammation. Also, make sure to have a balanced diet along with keeping the area clean and soft.
In case of any discharge or secretions, it is advised to undergo a swab test in which the secretions are tested by culture, and sensitivity testing wherein the presence of any bacteria or fungal elements may be found out, and any antibiotics or medications may also be provided within the report. To undergo the test, in-person consultation with the dermatologist may be required.

I isolated myself in the room without lights. I also suffer from migraine for the past many years. How to overcome depression? Due to this, I cannot concentrate on my studies. Please help.Thanks.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern.
I read your case, and you are on good antidepressants. Your doctor needs to increase the dose of medications. Suicide is not the solution to your problem, but there is always an excellent solution to the problem. You must take the help of someone. If possible, get admitted to the nearest hospital for a few days. Start counseling for your situation. You must take help of a clinical psychologist for it.
I hope this information will help you.

"Hello doctor,
I have a problem with my allergies. I believe I am allergic to pollen and I have these allergies all year long. I am always snuffing, wiping, started to have nose bleeds recently. I tried every over the counter allergy pill and spray and nothing gives me release. What should I do? Is there a doctors prescription I should take? Or remedies I could do? Any suggestions for anything to stop this discomfort and nosebleeds?","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Nose bleeds are due to running nose, dryness and crusting, all of which manifest in allergic rhinitis. You need to get a skin flick testing done to check what you are allergic to. Thereafter you should try allergen avoidance, pharmacotherapy and some precautions. If these fail, you can go for immunotherapy. If you need details, you may revert back.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,
I am a 21-year-old and have been severely suffering from a canker sore for the last three days. Kindly suggest a treatment.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have read your query and understand your concern. Canker sores can be very painful and cause a lot of distress. Mostly they are due to vitamin deficiency. So your food probably lacks the adequate amount of vitamins that you need. Try to have more green leafy vegetables like more saag spinach, broccoli, etc. Try to have a boiled egg daily with the yolk since it is a powerhouse of vitamins. Also, take a vitamin supplement capsule Cobazinc vitamin B complex with zinc, one capsule every night before sleep. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with them and take medicines with their consent. Sometimes canker sores are also caused due to excessive intake of acidic food such as spicy food or dentures. You can avoid spicy food for the time being and rely on a bland diet till the sore resolves. Also, I would suggest you use Listerine Thymol, Eucalyptol, Methyl Salicylate, Menthol mouthwash two to three times a day, preferably after meals. This will help in the fast healing of the sores. Make sure your diet is proper. Increase your vegetable intake, drink plenty of water, and take a capsule of Cobazinc daily.
I hope this helps.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have gone through your complaint and seen the picture attached to it attachment removed to protect patient identity. It looks like a case of stains with calculus, which is known in laymans terms as tartar. This can be due to many reasons. For example, not maintaining proper oral hygiene, smoking, excessive intake of tea, coffee or cold drink, or drinking fluoridated water. It can ultimately lead to a condition called as gingivitis or periodontitis, if not taken care of. The only solution to this is to get a scaling or cleaning of your teeth done by your dentist. Scaling is a routine cleaning procedure of the teeth, which is not painful. So, do not worry. There are no other means of cleaning your teeth except for scaling. After the procedure is done, the doctor will advise you to maintain your oral hygiene by brushing your teeth twice daily, flossing and using a regular mouthwash every day. Hope it helps.

I read your query and understand your concern.
Kindly answer the following questions.
After trauma, has any investigation been done?
Was there a fracture over the facial bone at the time of injury?
Was any treatment taken?
A bruise is because of the rupture of tiny blood vessels in superficial skin and subcutaneous tissue.
To treat the bruise ice pack is applied for ten minutes to reduce pain and swelling. A slight warm compress application also helps in improving circulation to that area. The use of aloe vera cream or topical Vitamin C get is also beneficial. Keep the face in an elevated position while sleeping.
To rule out bleeding disorder, platelet count, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin clotting time, and bleeding time can be done. I would suggest consulting a dermatologist in person for a physical examination and getting a prescription for the medicine.

"Hi doctor,I am 18 years old. I have been a competitive athlete in my whole life. About a year ago, I started experiencing palpitations, near syncopal episodes, and chest pain. I have seen three cardiologists. I have had a bicycle stress test, limited echocardiogram looking at just the thickness of my heart, and also multiple EKGs. Before four months, I had a cardiac loop recorder implanted. All the tests have been normal. I have also had a workup in many other systems of my body including, endocrine, neurology, pheochromocytoma, kidney circulation and multiple blood tests. All came back normal. I am experiencing that my toes were becoming either white or purple, numb and very cold. My heart rate increases with minimal activity. I also have a past medical history of Goldenhar syndrome. Before two years, my second cousin passed away at the age of 13 due to an anomaly of his left coronary artery.

"Hello doctor,I am unable to sleep properly at night. Kindly suggest something for a good sleep as because of this I cannot work properly. Kindly respond as soon as possible.Thank you.","Hello,Welcome to icliniq.com.I read your query and understand your query.From the above complaints, it seems you have a problem getting sleep. Insomnia has got both medical and psychiatric causes. The most common cause of insomnia is anxiety.
I have the following questions for you
How long have you been having this problem?
Do you worry a lot?
Are you frequently tense?
Do you get involved in excessive worrying?
getting caught up in thoughts?
Exam tension?
Worrying about your position or grade in your class?
If yes, let me know the following too
Do you have thyroid problems or gastritis?
Do you have any anxiety or depression?
Do you have any significant psychological stress?
Are you on any medication?
Do noise, light, or extreme temperatures hot or cold interfere with sleep?
Let me tell u it is not the quantity but the quality of sleep is all that matters. Good sleep is like a cure for a day times fatigue and tiredness. Good sleep is achieved only with a good sound mind. A sound mind is achieved only by relaxing, leaving all thoughts.Following are some tips for you
Avoid Napping.
Regular exercise helps u to fight bad sleep or insomnia but Avoid exercise late in the evening as it activates metabolism and also releases hormones that may not help u to sleep
Avoid bright screens like laptops, late-night television, mobiles, tablets, and all.
Keep your room dim and dark as darkness stimulates the brain to release melatonin that helps you to sleep avoid gadgets for the same reason.
Reading a book may help.
No brainstorming activity prior to sleep.
Keep your room clean, cool, and calm.
Maintain room temperature at about 65 to 70 F for good sleep.
Do not have tea or coffee or any stimulants.
Avoid carbonated drinks.
Avoid big meals, and spicy or junk food.
Do not drink too much water or any liquids as they will wake you up and make things worse.
There is nothing quite like sinking into a warm tub every day with a few drops of essential oil like lavender oil.
Drink a glass of warm milk 30 minutes prior to your sleep time.
Also, eat cherries and bananas which are rich sources of tryptophan, a molecule that transforms into the sleep-inducing molecule melatonin.
Try to go to sleep at the same time each night and get up at the same time each morning.
I hope I did not load you with too much advice. I come across many patients having sleep problems that affect their day badly. Well, you require six hours of good sleep for a good routine. Just switch your biological sleep accordingly and sleep by 1000 PM. It is always wise to follow the natural ways to sleep. Taking sleeping pills only acts acutely and in the longer run further complicates your sleep cycle and causes memory problems, confusion, and daytime sleepiness.Hope my reply helps you to find some good sleep. Do revert to me if you need any further medical information or medical help for sleep.All the best.

Prednisone especially will start acting after a few hours. So my suggestion is to wait until it starts its action. However, it might take somewhere from two to three weeks for most of that swelling to come down. Do not worry for now.

Your exposure was not sufficient enough to acquire human immunodeficiency virus HIV virus. Frankly speaking I have not seen a single case of HIV Human Immunodeficiency Virus with such a short exposure. Oral sex particularly from the donor point of view is considered as safest sexual practice as far as HIV is considered.Various studies have shown the amount of HIV in saliva is almost nil. Therefore, in many countries it is not even considered as a potential exposure for post-exposure prophylaxis. I am quite sure that you will not acquire HIV with such a brief exposure. Further, you are taking post-exposure prophylaxis PEP, which will also decrease the chances. But, personally I would not have prescribed the one for such exposure. So, be assured of yours being HIV negative. Go for fourth generation test if you want.

I have read the query, and I can understand your concern.
Her problem may be due to weakness as she has heavy bleeding, and her weight is also inadequate. Her white discharge can be due to a fungal infection. She should go for a vaginal discharge examination to find the cause. Painful menstruation and heavy bleeding occur due to many factors, it can be hormonal. She should go for ultrasonography to find the underlying cause. So, get her TSH thyroid stimulating hormone level checked. Her Hb Hemoglobin level is checked to rule out anemia.

"Hello doctor,
I had overdosed on multiple medicines two years back, which included eight iron tablets on two occasions, 16 tablets of Avil 25 mg, and SSRI twice, all on different occasions. Two years back, my SGPT was 106 months after my last overdose incident, and my creatinine was 1.2. Since then, my SGPT has been 12 to 15 and creatinine 0.6. My BUN is 6. Do you think I have damaged my liver and kidney?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
It seems you had an overdose of a few medicines two years back. This will usually cause transient damage to your liver and kidney. These organs will recover completely if there is no underlying inherent disease for them. You need to avoid any further occurrences like this. Nothing to worry about as of now. Keep a close watch to avoid any unnecessary medications and foods which can give these organs a hit. Avoid alcohol, unnecessary painkillers, over-the-counter medications, etc. When did you do a liver function test and kidney function test last? If not done in the last six months, do get it done.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,
Two weeks ago, I hurt my back by deadlifting. The pain was severe, and I believe it was a herniated disc in my sciatic nerve. I started PT immediately with press-ups religiously, and a week in, I bought an inversion table and started using that. Two weeks later, I am sleeping through the night pain-free, can walk several miles relatively pain-free, not using any Ibuprofen or Tylenol, and have very little nerve pain. Is it possible I am on a fast track to recovery because of the diligent action for recovery? With how I feel now, what is the realistic time frame for this to heal and for me to get back into exercising without worrying about re-injury?","Hello,
Welcome to the icliniq.com.
I am sorry to hear about your accident and I am glad that you are recovering well.  As you have mentioned that the pain started after lifting weights, so it must be because of disc prolapse or muscular strain of back.  I think, as per my experience, you will take two more months to recover and return to activities. Meanwhile you should start gentle back exercises.

"Hi doctor,
My friend gifted me a pack that contains vitamin C serum, Hyaluronic acid, Niacinamide, and Retinol. I need to learn how to use it. The doctor prescribed Glyco 12 Glycolic acid cream for melasma.
Please advise me on how to use these products.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
First, the product kit gifted by your friend is a perfect combination for treating skin disorders. These skin disorders include discoloration, textural variations, mild acne, skin tone differences, dark spots due to post inflammatory hyperpigmentation, and excessively oily or dry skin, as seen in the case of melasma.
The order of application of skin care products
1. Skin care products are to be applied according to their viscosity or thickness after using a face wash. Therefore, the first product to be applied needs to be the one in the most liquid form toner following the product with a thicker consistency serum may be applied, then creams and sunscreens.
2. Vitamin C serums and Hyaluronic acid serums or creams are to be applied in the morning. Since vitamin C serum consists of Ascorbic acid, which is an antioxidant that helps in protecting your skin from sun exposure and helps with worsening dark spots, it also supports very gentle peeling not visualized to the naked eye. In addition, it helps fade dark spots and hyperpigmentation on the skin due to scavenging free radicals, leading to dark marks and aging.
Hyaluronic acid serums and creams are to be used twice daily to help bring up skin smoothening and rejuvenation and make skin look younger and plumper.
3. Retinol serum or cream are vitamin A derivatives. Therefore, they lead to mild to moderate peeling of the skin, which may sometimes be noticed evidently they help remove dark spots, acne, textural repair of skin, and tone differences. However, since they are solid, first-time users may experience skin irritation, redness, evident peeling, and burning sensation. Therefore, it is advised to be used once a week initially for at least two months, and once you notice that your skin is not sensitive, they may be increased in frequency to twice a week for three weeks, then every two days for three weeks and later alternate days also for life long. Also, since they may cause mild skin sensitivity to sunlight, they are always applied at night before sleep and should be washed off well in the morning.
4. Niacinamide serum or cream is to be used at night. It helps in removing hyperpigmentation and textural imbalances on the skin by rejuvenating and nonvisual, very gentle peeling that makes the skin glowy and smoother. They may be applied at night except when retinol is used.
5. Since there is no mention of the medium of the product except for vitamin C, which is mentioned as a serum, I request you provide the details in a query.
6. Assuming that the Hyaluronic acid and Niacinamide are serums and the rest are creams, the order of application mentioned as A.M. morning and P.M. night routine includes
AM
Face wash containing vitamin C serum four to five drops to be applied all over facial skin. Please wait for one minute till it gets well absorbed. Next, four to five drops of Hyaluronic serum are to be used, then wait for one minute and later sunscreen is to be applied every two hours without washing off the previous layers of the product as sunscreens lose efficacy every two hours.
PM
Face wash, Niacinamide serum, and Hyaluronic acid serum or cream.
Retinol serum two to three drops or cream if cream, then use a pea-sized amount once a week and avoid Niacinamide on those days. Also, apply Retinol on a clean and dry face. There must not be any dampness or water on your face and hands before applying. Apply only a pea-sized amount of the product, mix it with a moisturizer of the same amount, buffer well and apply on the skin. Dab the product into the skin and do not rub. Ensure the dabbing is done until the product is absorbed into your facial skin well. Wait for ten minutes, and then apply a great moisturizer on top of the layer. If using Hyaluronic acid serum, use the serum four to five drops first after using the face wash. Again, please wait ten minutes and apply the Retinol product once it is dry.
As mentioned in history, Glycolic acid cream is not required if Retinol is used, as both are extremely strong. One of the either to be used. Retinol is a very beneficial product. Therefore, if Retinol is used, you can avoid Glycolic acid cream.
In case of further queries, do follow up. Also, kindly provide more product details if additional information is needed.
Hope the details were informative and precise.
I hope I can help. Stay happy, healthy, and safe.

"Hi doctor,
I am a 52-year-old male with a weight of 176 pounds. I am diabetic. My doctor advised me to take Gabapentin NT 400 for neuropathy. Previously, I was taking Pregabalin 150 mg. On seeing some reviews online, I found that ninety percent of patients are against taking Gabapentin. It causes confusion in me and so I am willing to have a second opinion. Kindly advise.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Gabapentin is more potent than Pregabalin. It is an excellent drug. The possible side effect is dizziness. As you have taken Pregabalin 150 mg previously and so Gabapentin suits you. Gabapentin NT contains Nortryptilline which helps with neuropathic pain. Most of the diabetologist prefer it. I suggest you start taking it and if there are any adverse effects, then we can go for other options. There are no other options other than Pregabalin or Gabapentin for diabetic neuropathy.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 88, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hi doctor,I have felt stinging on the skin for the past three months. It is not pins and needles but a stinging and pricking feeling. More on the lower body, the tricep area, and the stomach. It sometimes happens at the back, and I also get this tingling or feather touch feeling on the face. It has been super frustrating. I got a bunch of blood work done and an MRI for the brain and spine to rule out MS. The neurologist gave me an SSRI which is Lexapro Cipralex 5 mg.

"Hi doctor,
I am 47 years old woman and I have been dealing with health complications for most of my life and so I have managed well with diet and exercise. I have presented with ataxia on three different occasions and IV antioxidant therapies were helpful to relieve my symptoms. A few years ago, carnitine was recommended to my daughter and me after going through some organic acid tests. The reports showed that I have some issues with the 3 methyl glutaric acids and my daughters with 3 methyl glutaric acids. I would also mention that I have chronic muscle spasms, with clinical manifestations related to ocular disturbance, pain, kidney pain, heart fluttering while sleeping, and loss of smell with no autoimmune markers. I can say that I have a long list of muscle issues and multisystem affectation with some mitochondrial alteration which can be genetic also. So, I want to know what is the correct genetic tests.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern. You have a chronic myopathic problem along with some episodes of ataxia and cardiac problems. It seems that some evaluation and screening tests that have been done previously including MRI, EMG, and blood tests and the results convinced you that you suffer from some kind of mitochondrial disorder. The fact that your daughter has some vague similar problems may suggest that some inheritance evidence exists. But I require detailed data to be able to propose the genetic tests to you. Apart from that, I want a few answers to questions like,
How long has your ataxia lasted?
Whether it was confirmed by a neurological examination or not.
Did your brain MRI show any abnormal signs?
What is your EMG diagnosis?
What are the results of laboratory tests?
Are tests such as serum pyruvate and lactate been checked?
Are you been examined by an ophthalmologist for seeking evidence of retinopathy which is prevalent in mitochondrial diseases?

"Hello doctor,I am 21-years-old and have been masturbating for the last seven years. I have become thin and addicted to porn sites. I have become frustrated and want to quit this habit. I tried so many ways but could not. Please help.Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have read the query, and I can understand your concern.
Masturbation does not cause any weakness or sexual dysfunction, contrary to popular belief. Remove any porn material from your mobile or laptop. Set a lock for porn sites it will act as a primary barrier. Follow a flexible routine, exercise regularly, and take a balanced diet. Meditation daily for at least half an hour in the morning helps you relax and focus. Try to get involved in other fun activities when you feel the urge to masturbate, such as reading, exercising, listening to music, etc. Try to imagine a happy situation and try to focus on it. If none of these approaches work, you can seek out cognitive behavior therapy CBT from a therapist. Remember that every issue can be resolved you simply need to attempt, and assistance is nearby.
I hope this will help you. Feel free to ask if you have any further queries.

Please help me to look into it.
Thanks.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Lumps or lymph nodes enlargement on the neck are often met with many conditions. The most common cause is tooth decay or infection inside the oral cavity or gums. Ear infection also produces lymph node enlargement. If you have a chronic infection, then the glands will be persistent.
How big are the glands?
How many are there?
Are they painful?
Does it feel like more than two are stuck together, or can you feel each one separately?
Even if you have infections, like tooth decay or ear infection, we must not neglect these glands.
There are certain conditions where lymph nodes enlargement is seen without any primary infection, like various types of lymphomas, tuberculous glands, and some blood diseases. So you have to see a surgeon and find out of this can be left alone or if it should be investigated. So please fix up an appointment with your doctor so that he can personally examine and find out.

Please help.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I went through your query and understood your concern.
I have a few suggestions,
1. Excess exposure to screens television, laptop, and mobile phones can cause watery eyes. This is a rising problem in children.
2. He needs to be educated on the ill effects of over-screen usage. Encourage him to play outdoors, involving traditional games.
3. Dry eyes can also cause watering.
4. Regarding eating habits, there is no quick fix remedy, and you need to keep trying healthy food options with a reward approach. Punishment does not help.
5. Make sure his hemoglobin levels are normal, as low hemoglobin levels can lead to anemia and can cause a decrease in appetite.
6. I suggest you to deworm him with syrup Bandy Plus Albendazole and Ivermectin 2.5 ml once a week every six months. Worm infestation is known to cause decreased appetite.
7. I also suggest you to try giving syrup Aptizoom natural appetite stimulant 3 ml once a day. But it is a temporary option. Trying a variety of homemade food is always better.
8. Kindly consult an ophthalmologist and inquire about the need for spectacle due to refractive error.
Kindly consult a specialist, talk with them and take the medications with their consent.

"Hi doctor,
I am a 54 year old male. I got a bypass heart surgery 12 years ago. During that time, my gallbladder had multiple small stones, which were silent according to the doctor. The location and position of these stones were found static during regular ultrasound tests. Four years back, I consulted a doctor, he also said that as it is silent and non-movable stones, there is no need to operate till there is no pain. I got an ultrasound two months back. Please see the attached report, and let me know what action needs to be taken? I do not have any pain or discomfort.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have gone through the reports attachment removed to protect patient identity.
The reports show chronic calculous cholecystitis. And as you do not have any symptoms like biliary colic or acute severe abdominal pain, it is asymptomatic chronic cholecystitis.
Asymptomatic cholecystitis is managed expectantly, that is when symptoms or complications develop. The ultrasound shows no gallbladder wall thickening, edema, or distended gallbladder. Most commonly, stones are due to lithogenic bile or stasis of bile within the gallbladder.
What is your abdominal girth?
Do you have diabetes?
Are you on any medication?
Recent lipid profile result?
I suggest you try using tablet Udiliv Ursodeoxycholic acid 300 mg twice daily. This decreases lithogenicity of the bile. Take less fatty meal.
As a final note, chronic fibrotic and static gallbladder poses a minimal risk of adenocarcinoma.
In your case, the wall and size of the gallbladder are not mentioned. Your common bile duct is also fine, and hence, surgery can be planned expectantly.

You suffer from allergic rhinitis. You can suffer from it from a known or unknown allergen. You can be allergic to atmospheric pollutants confined to your house or dust that circulates in the air due to usage of ceiling fans or table fans. For now, follow these measures. You need to change your bedsheets and pillowcases often. Clean your blanket and use it after air-dried under the sun. Air dry your mattresses under the sun. Try to clean your room and house including cabinets with a wet mop or wet cloth. Do not use a brush to clean as the dust particles survive in the air. Wear a mask while cleaning your house. Continue using Duonase as it is really effective. You can start taking tablet Levocetirizine with Montelukast twice daily for two weeks and reduce it gradually to once a day. Take it at night before an hour of going to bed for the next two weeks. For some people, it causes sedation. So avoid driving after taking this tablet. Avoid any forms of allergens.

"Hello doctor,
I am experiencing an issue where my eyes have been producing thick, white, sticky strings recently. Can you help me identify the cause?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I read your query and understood your concern. From your description, it sounds like you may be experiencing an increase in eye discharge or mucus production. There could be several potential causes for this, including
Dry Eyes Insufficient tear production can cause the eyes to become dry and result in the formation of thick strings of mucus.
Allergies Allergic reactions to environmental factors such as pollen, dust, or pet dander can cause increased mucus production in the eyes.
Conjunctivitis Also known as pink eye, conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the conjunctiva the clear tissue covering the white part of the eye. It can cause excessive mucus discharge.
Blepharitis This is a condition characterized by inflammation of the eyelid margins and can lead to increased mucus production and crustiness around the eyelashes.
Infections Eye infections, such as bacterial or viral conjunctivitis, can cause increased eye discharge.
I suggest you use an antibiotic eye drop like Ciprofloxacin and lubricant for discomfort. I hope this has helped you. Kindly follow up if you have more doubts.

Welcome to the icliniq.com.
I have read your attached report attachment removed to protect patient identity, and the following is my opinion for your case.
Your total WBC count is borderline low. It can be decreased temporarily due to some inflammation. You have to repeat CBC complete blood count after ten days to recheck total WBC count.
Your low MCV, high red blood cell count and borderline low hemoglobin could be due to some hemoglobinopathy. For that, I suggest you investigate further with Hb electrophoresis by HPLC method high-performance liquid chromatography and serum iron profile study.
You can revert with reports once done to guide you further.

I noticed a change in the color of my penis. I am always conscious about the color of my penis, and it appears darker now. I think it is due to excessive masturbation without any lubrication. The color change is less significant when erect. It is getting worse day by day. And I am devoid of masturbating without a lubricant and reduced the time of masturbation too.

It is seen only in your foreskin area. Kindly make sure you do not have phimosis and share the picture of your erect penis picture front side.
It can be due to the following reasons
1 It can be due to vitamin deficiency, so I would suggest you take capsule Astymin Forte Biotin, Calcium pantothenate, Cyanocobalamin, Folic acid, L-isoleucine, L-leucine, L-lysine, L-valine, Methionine, Niacinamide, Pyridoxine, Riboflavin, Thiamine mononitrate, Tyrothricin, Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Vitamin D3, Vitamin E  once daily after food for 30 days.
2 If it is due to infection from unprotected sex, we need to think of sexually transmitted disease and undergo the following test
Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay TPHA.
HSV test herpes simplex virus.
Chlamydia tests.
HIV screening test.
3 It can also be a bacterial infection. You can use ointment T-Bact Mupirocin for local application and Doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for five days.
4 For the vitiligo patch, we need to assess the family history.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
As per the description, you seem to have improper occlusal contacts. I want to know about the fit of your retainer. Please mention whether it fits properly. In most cases, it is just the feeling of patients that they feel to have some different contacts during biting. Most of the time, it becomes fine on its own. But in your case, you need to consult your orthodontist. You should know that a retainer is an appliance that helps to maintain teeth in position after undergoing orthodontic treatment. It is essential for maintaining the teeth in position. You have told me that you started to have this disturbing occlusion after having this waiting phase. I want to know whether you can be able to point out the touching area. It can be a high point. If it is a minor problem, then it can be corrected. In most cases, patients feel to have a disturbed occlusion due to a new biting produced without an appliance. If this is not the cause, then you need to check your fitting of the retainer. If everything is fine, then check for high points where it is touching first.","{'score': 92, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 80, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Your weight gain is due to hypothyroidism and probable physical inactivity. I need to know what is your recent TSH thyroid-stimulating hormone level if it is not in a reasonable range, your medication dose needs to be adjusted. Also, do 30 minutes of aerobic exercise daily, avoid sweets, carbonated beverages, and nonveg food. As of your scan report is concerned it is suggestive of atrophic thyroiditis where the thyroid gland shrinks and later becomes inactive. So you may require thyroid hormone supplement. But your scan finding is nothing to worry about.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I went through your query and understand your concern.
I would like to assure you that this is not a case of a missed pill, as you vomited four hours after taking the medication. This is primarily due to a side effect of the hormone preparation, which will go away after a few days. If you have taken the pack consistently until the last week, your chances of pregnancy are nil. Because you had intercourse two days after taking the pill, which was followed by vomiting four hours later, there is no chance of pregnancy and no reason to take another pill after that. When used regularly, the hormonal contraceptives Microlite Ethinyloestradiol 20 mcg and Levonorgestrel 100 mcg has a nearly 99.9  success rate.

Should I wrap my hand in a bandage after applying Thrombophob for a faster effect? I have to take my exams, and I have also been suffering from hepatitis A for the past three months.Kindly help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I read your query and can understand your concern.
Swelling and discoloration of the hands after cannula removal is a common side effect known as phlebitis. It typically resolves on its own within a few days to a week. But if you are still experiencing pain and swelling after five days, then I recommend you take some of these additional measures, such as keeping the affected hand elevated, applying ice packs, or taking over-the-counter pain relievers to help manage the discomfort. As for wrapping your hand with a bandage, do it after applying ointment. Thrombophob Heparin and Benzyl nicotinate are recommended. Thrombophob is a medication used to prevent blood clots, but wrapping your hand tightly with a bandage could potentially impede blood flow and worsen the swelling. Wrap a loose dressing over the ointment.
I hope this information will help you.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
It does not look like a matter of worry. However, since you told about a murmur, you should get one echo done to look for the cause for it. Have you got hemoglobin checked ever? For palpitations, low hemoglobin can cause it. It can also occur with a valve problem as you told about the murmur. Also, extra beats which are usually benign can cause this. So it does not appear to be an emergency. But, you should get yourself evaluated with an ECG electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and hemoglobin.

1 Does she have any symptoms like nausea, malaise, vomiting, or abdominal pain?
2 How many hours have passed since she has taken the PCM Paracetamol tablets?
3 Did she take all the medicines together or overtook them over some time?
Tablet Paracetamol overdose has a total of four phases. The first phase initial 24 hours has nausea, vomiting, weakness, and lethargy. In the second phase 24 to 72 hours, these symptoms improve, but the effect on the liver starts. Finally, after 72 hours, actual signs of liver damage will begin.
For the age and weight of your cousin, a dose of 10 g 18 x 650 mg taken together is likely to cause severe liver damage. Any amount greater than 7.5 g taken together can cause severe damage. Even if it is taken over 24 hours, it would still affect the liver. I would advise you not to ignore these symptoms and to get her tests for LFTs liver function test or RFTs renal function test and INR international normalized ratio done at the earliest.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have seen your blood tests attachment removed to protect patient identity.
You are overweight. Your HbA1c glycated hemoglobin is in the pre-diabetic range, but your fasting and postprandial sugar levels are normal. Your HDL high-density lipoprotein is quite low, whereas LDL low-density lipoprotein and TG triglycerides are a little bit above the desired range. Your vitamin B12 level is also low. Are you a vegetarian? It might be low because of that. Your TSH is high and T3, T4 are normal and is called as subclinical hypothyroidism You did not mention about any of your symptoms or problems. Usually, we start medication for hypothyroidism once TSH thyroid-stimulating hormone is 10, or over 10, if the patient has symptoms, high lipids, or high TPO antibodies. My advice is right now to do TPO thyroid peroxidase antibodies. If this is positive, then you may need to start on Levothyroxine, especially if you have symptoms. If it is normal, then just repeat your TSH after six months.
Regarding your overweight and lipids derangement, you need to follow lifestyle modifications. Consume a low carbohydrate diet and no added sugar. No sugary juices, bread, rice, pasta, and potatoes. If you cannot stop, at least take as little as possible. Consume more vegetable salads. Take fruits only as a sweet dish. Do not take mango, grapes, and banana. Strawberries and other berries are fine. Intermittent fasting will also help you to control your weight. You can fast for 16 hours like taking your dinner at 7 PM and do not eat anything after that. Then you can take your breakfast at 11 AM the next day. During fasting just drink water and green tea without sugar. You can extend fasting to 24 hours then 36 hours as your body adopts. You can fast two times a week or as you feel comfortable. It will control your weight.
Drink more water. Sleep well and do exercise at least 30-40 minutes daily. The more you practice these things, the better will be your control overweight. Check your vitamin D levels and repeat HbA1c after three months along with FBS and RBS fasting and random blood sugars.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

I understand your concern. Masturbation is a normal natural process. It has no side effects on the body, but you can gradually reduce it to once. But like you said you have the inability to concentrate it is because of the guilt you are having of masturbation.
I hope this has helped you.

"Hello doctor,
Recently, my friend inhaled half a bottle of phenyl accidentally. As a result, she had severe vomiting and was admitted to the hospital and discharged in a day. Now, she has a high fever, is unable to eat anything, and is vomiting whatever she eats. How long will it take for her to recover?
Kindly advise.","Hello,
Welcome back to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern and will surely help you out.
Did she inhale the phenyl or consume it? If inhaled, there is nothing much to worry about. However, if she has consumed it, she needs Ryle tube insertion and stomach aspiration. Initially, there will be CNS stimulation followed by CNS depression and coma. Fever may be due to hospital-acquired pneumonia or any other infection. I suggest you consult your doctor for further investigations and treatment.
I hope this helps.
Take care.","{'score': 87, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 7, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 85, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,My 8-year-old son was diagnosed with a possible bone marrow failure during monitoring for low platelets when he was 3 years old. His biopsy showed areas of 20  cellularity. Last year his counts were WBC 13.8, RBC 4.83, hemoglobin 13.5 gdL, hematocrit 39.3, MCV 81.3, MCH 27.9, MCHC 34.2, RDW 13.5, platelet count 311, and MPV 8.5.

Should we see an oncologist again?","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
You had mentioned the history of bone marrow failure at three years of age, but the cause and workup done at that time are not mentioned here.
Temporary viral infection like parvovirus can lead to temporary bone marrow suppression.
In a child, if platelet count remains low for a long time, then ITP idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura should be ruled out by bone marrow aspiration.
Please provide a detailed history about the past bone marrow failure workup if available.
As far as this latest CBC complete blood count report is concerned, it does not look abnormal. So, if any symptoms are present and if CBC worsens, then you should consult your doctor.","{'score': 85, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 5, 'transparency': 8}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 74, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 9}"
"Hello doctor,
I have had a small hard pea-sized lump in my private part for the past few days and I feel embarrassed about it. I needed some advice regarding the same.
Please help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I went through your query and understood your concern.
I request you share a picture of the affected area. If there was unprotected sex, then it may be due to sexually transmitted infections. I suggest you do the following tests.
1. TPHA Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay.
2. Human papilloma virus DNA PCR polymerase chain reaction test.
3. Herpes simplex virus HSV1 IgM serum test.
4. Chlamydia trachomatis IgG antibody test.
5. HIV human immunodeficiency virus screening test.
6. Hepatitis B surface antigen test.
7. Urine complete analysis.
If it is not a sexually transmitted disease, it can be a bacterial infection. So, I suggest you follow the instructions mentioned below in case of a bacterial infection.
1. Use an antibiotic ointment for local application.
2. Take a tablet of Doxycycline tetracycline 100 milligrams twice daily for five days.
3, Use a good antifungal ointment in case of itching.
4. Maintain the hygiene of your private parts by using lukewarm water and no soap.
Kindly consult a specialist doctor, talk with them, and take medicines with their consent.

"Hello doctor,
The patient is my mother, age 58, with chronic psoriasis which is under control. She has been having right foot swelling for the past two months. Her left feet is normal. Initial diagnosis at local clinics was an infection and severe arthritis. She was put on anti-inflammatory, antibiotics and antifungal cream. There was some symptomatic relief but the swelling did not resolve. X-ray of her feet was reported mild bone degeneration. Otherwise no other significant pathology. She was admitted to the hospital two weeks ago. FBS, ESR and uric acid were reported as normal. She was put on cryotherapy and physiotherapy. She has been discharged to home now.
Her condition is slightly better but the pain and swelling did not resolve completely. She has a few more cycles of physiotherapy to follow. She remembers spraining her right feet two weeks before the entire episode of the swelling started. As she did not feel any pain or discomfort immediately after the incident, she just ignored the sprain incident. She also had a hysterectomy done two years ago due to calcified fibroids which caused occasional leg swelling at that time. Please advise what has to be done.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have reviewed your health query and can understand how worried you are about your mother.
This seems to be due to the foot sprain she inflicted in the recent past attachment removed to protect patient identity. She might have caused a damage to the soft tissues of the right foot. She has got swelling of the foot due to local inflammation of the soft tissues of the foot. She should keep up with the physical therapy and cryotherapy as this would assist her to relieve this inflammation. She should also keep taking medications as these medications not only relieve the pain but also inflammation.
She should keep the right leg up while laying down and should not hang the leg down while sitting. This change in leg position would help a lot as this avoids pooling of blood down due to gravity. Pooling of blood leads to more swelling in feet. There is nothing more you need to do in this situation. Just keep up with the cryotherapy and physical therapy. It would take her back to normal life very soon.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 71, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 9}"

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern. You are having a form of folliculitis. It is a bacterial infection of the hair follicle that occur due to ingrown hair. The growth of ingrown hair can get aggravated due to shaving practice and it needs to be corrected. It is better to trim the hair rather than shaving it. You can apply Fusidic cream after cleansing the area thoroughly in the morning and afternoon. You can use Tretinoin cream 2 cream only at night for two weeks. Keep the area dry and always sterilize your shaving device before using it. For treating dark spots, you can use Kojivit cream Kojic acid after taking treatment with Tretinoin. Avoid shaving and plucking hair on the area until the flareup subsides.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 83, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}"
"Hi doctor,
This concerns my mothers BP blood pressure. She is nearly 154 pounds in weight and has been on BP blood pressure treatment for the last four months, and here I am giving a summary regarding her BP treatment. Four months ago, the first time the treating physician checked her BP for the first time. It was around 19090, and the doctor prescribed Telmipil AM 1-0-0 for the first month. After 30 days of Telmipil AM 1-0-0, when her BP got checked once again, there was no improvement in reading, so the doctor changed to Telmipil trio 40512.5 for the second month. After 30 days of Telmipil trio 40512.5, again her BP got checked, and again it was the same, only around 19090, and the doctor prescribed Terminal CT 4012.5  with Cardio retard 10 1-1-1 for the third month. After 30 days of Telmipil CT 4012.5 with Cardio retard 10 1-1-1, her BP got checked, and that time around 18090, and again, not that much improvement. This time doctor prescribed Telmipil ct 4012.5 with Nicardia retard 20 1-0-1 with Nicardia retard 10 0-1-0 for the fourth month. After ten days of Telmipil CT 4012.5 with Nicardia retard 20 1-0-1 with Nicardia retard 10 0-1-0, the doctor once again checked her BP. That time it came around 17080 mmHg, and based on this value, he increased the dose of Nicardia retard 20 and asked her to continue Telmipil CT 4012.5 with Nicardia retard 20 1-1-1 for the fourth month. After 30 days of Telmipil CT 4012.5 with Nicardia retard 20 1-1-1 yesterday, we visited him, and to our surprise, when he checked his BP, it was 200100. So this time also no effect of the medicines as mentioned above. Instead, her BP got increased this time. I asked him whether should she go for renal arteries doppler ultrasound or what? as her BP was not reducing and, he said, no need. This time he added one more medicine named Arkamin 100 mcg 0.5-0.5-0.5. So this time, he asked her to continue Telmipil CT 4012.5 with Nicardia retard 20 1-1-1 with Arkamin 100 mcg 0.5-0.5-0.5 for the fifth month and asked us to visit after 30 days. so here my concern is, with the latest prescribed BP medicines, would you think of any improvement in her BP value after 30 days? After four months of taking a variety of BP medicines, as discussed above, there is no effect at all, sometimes decreasing a little bit, sometimes increasing, sometimes neutral no effects, so why no effects of any BP medicines so far? Also, despite this much higher BP of 200100 mmHg as per the latest prescription, no symptoms were observed of high BP in her, and she can do her activities like a normal person only without any problem. Also, the treating physician is saying no need for renal arteries doppler ultrasound test despite no improvement. So, here I seek your valuable opinion and according to you if any tests like I mentioned above are needed to check for anything suspicious. So kindly suggest what should be done for her BP to bring it down to normal. Your perfect and accurate opinion will matter a lot. Also, is any improvement needed in current BP treatments, according to you? Thank you.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I do feel she needs ambulatory BP blood pressure monitoring to see her BP and variations throughout the day rather than just measurements at the physicians clinic. This is to rule out what is known as white coat hypertension which is due to high BP at the time of measurement in the physician or nurses office and normal BP at other times also given that her BP is 19090 mmHg. Hence pulse pressure is that systolic and diastolic BP is high of 100 mm hg. I would suggest an echocardiogram in her to rule out aortic regurgitation leakage of aortic valves, which could result in a similar BP recording. Also, in all cases of apparently resistant BP, we need to do an MRI magnetic resonance imagingand USG ultrasonography of the abdomen. Specifically the kidney and suprarenal area to rule out adrenal and suprarenal masses and coarctation of the aorta, which could cause resistant BP.  A USG abdomen would also rule out significant renal vascular disease anyway, her urea creatinine and potassium are normal. Also, a hormonal assay of thyroid hormones is needed.

Rubbing penis and vagina will not cause pregnancy. But, if it was after ejaculating outside and then rubbing and fingering can allow few sperm to get in.

Your pain seems to be due to gas and bloating that causes you trouble. A possible explanation is foods that you eat produce lots of gases. Things you can do to prevent this and improve your symptoms is by avoiding foods that produce excessive gases, namely milk, peas, cereals, wheat, and other flour-based items. You should avoid it.

"Hello doctor,
I have a pimple that bursts by itself. When it burst, I thought it was best to get all the pus out by squeezing it.

Thank you.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have read the query, and I can understand your concern.
Firstly, you need to consult a dermatologist nearby to assess the grade and severity of acne. If acne is mild, topical anti-acne creams, like Clindamycin or Adapalene, will help. Anti-acne creams are started simultaneously with oral medications such as Azithromycin and Doxycycline, with or without isotretinoin, if the acne is severe. As a general treatment measure, I suggest
Use a face wash for oily skin like Cutiwash Aqua, Cocamidopropyl betaine, Lactic acid or a mild cleanser to wash your face.
Apply Clindamycin gel in the morning and Adapalene gel at night over the acne lesions.
Remove any whiteheads or blackheads if you have them.
Avoid squeezing pimples as it will leave a mark.
Consult a specialist doctor, talk to them, and then take the medication. Follow these above measures for two weeks to see how much response you get. If the acne is of mild grade, then it will respond. However, oral medication will be needed if the condition is severe.
I hope this will help you.

Yes, tailbone pain may be due to injury during delivery of baby or trauma during procedure. You may suffer pain during sitting or defecation, or intercourse. Use a doughnut shape pillow, and sit in a leaning forward position. Also, check for lumbar spondylosis, which may cause stiffness of the spine or muscle spasm by MRI magnetic resonance imaging or X-ray of the joint.

"Hi doctor,
I am a 51-year-old female. Since last year, I have been a type 2 diabetic patient, and I got my sugar level tested at the beginning of this year. It was 7.3 percent. For the last two months, I am having pain in my right leg below the knee, making it difficult for me to move, sit, and walk. Kindly suggest proper treatment and advice. At present, I am taking Eliptin M one tablet every day. So again, kindly suggest proper treatment for getting relief from my pain.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
7.3 percent of HbA1c glycated hemoglobin is slightly high. Try to make it less than 7 percent so that you can achieve better control. Your leg pain can be either myalgia or neuralgia. Have you tested your TFT thyroid function test, LFT liver function test, and CBC complete blood count? For the time being, I suggest you Aceclofenac Paracetamol drug and some vitamin supplements. Take tablet Pregabalin 75 mg at night will reduce the pain, which you can take for a month, Tablet Zerodol P Aceclofenac and Paracetamol morning and night after food, Tablet Pan 40 Pantoprazole morning and night one hour before food, Tablet Evion LC Levocarnitine and Vitamin E in the morning, Tablet Renerve plus Multivitamin at night, and take Calcium tablets daily. You can take Glyciphage 500 mg Metformin after dinner if you take Eliptin M Teneligliptin and Metformin in the morning or vice versa so that sugar level also does not increase. Take these medicines for a week and follow up.","{'score': 93, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 89, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,
My culture from my gynecologist came back, showing that I have a yeast infection as well as Beta Strep. I was hoping for more information on Beta Strep. I have never heard of it, and there is a lot of information when I searched that is making me confused a little. I am not experiencing any symptoms, either. I feel perfectly fine.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
There are lots of bacteria and other organisms that colonize healthy skin. Yeast a fungus also is a commensal in our body. Just the presence of these organisms is of no significance. The colony count is needed, which is high, will need a course of antibiotics, which can be decided by culture and sensitivity. But after a surgery like what you had, or any significant stress or use of lots of antibiotics as would have happened after surgery or use of steroids or diabetes, all infections show an altered balance between good and bad bacteria. You do not need any treatment for this. Just wait for your body to develop those good bacteria, and gradually, all tests will come negative. If you have any symptoms, treat as per need. Avoid unnecessary antibiotics use. They will further delay the recovery.

"Hello doctor,
I just went to my general practitioner due to recently having some issues with shortness of breath and an odd sensation in my heart area. I suspected it was nothing but went in anyways just to be sure. The sensation in my heart area is not at all painful, but just a sensation of fullness or tightness. I got an EKG done, and the results said I have a minor interior repolarization disturbance, consider ischemia, LV overload or aspecific change. flat or low negative T in AVF with negative T in III. I am a 29 year old male in generally good shape. I smoked for about 10 years but quit two years ago. I still smoke marijuana daily. Also, about eight years ago, I had a root canal done, and it has now re-infected twice. I am scheduled for an apicoectomy next month to deal with the asymptomatic infection. I only mention this as I am worried that maybe the untreated infection could have spread from the root of the tooth to my heart? Also, I live at 7,000 feet elevation which I am sure does not help the shortness of breath, but have lived here about six years. I am currently very nervous thinking I have a serious issue. Can anyone tell me what these results mean? My general practitioner referred me to a cardiologist but I do not want to be a nervous wreck until I hear from them.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have carefully reviewed your detailed query. You definitely need an in-person cardiologist consultation for appropriate evaluation of the issues. Only EKG electrocardiogram is not conclusive in such a case. We need to listen to the heart and then go for thorough physical exam. Tests may include but not limited to exercise stress test, echocardiography, thallium scan, chest X-ray, CT computed tomography scan, angiography and others if needed. Once ruled out we can say with confidence if there is any issue that needs proper management. Yes, an infection can spread from the teeth and throat infection to heart and can be diagnosed. Blood work also helps in this regards to find out infectious agents in blood and due to infection, any changes in the blood. If there is blockage to any of the blood vessels supplying the heart, there are chances of shortness of breath and patient can be short of breath even talking for some time, little physical activity or climbing the stairs. Do not panic and just follow as directed by your primary care and go for cardiologist evaluation. Meanwhile, go for apicoectomy and keep in touch with your dentist. Hope it helps.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 96, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,I want to know if Lonopin injection can be used before IVF in vitro fertilization embryo transfer and if laser hatching and blastocyst can be used together with the donor egg. I am advised to use ED and OD at a time in IVF. Is that right, or am I misguided? Kindly suggest.Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I can understand your concern.
Lonopin is low molecular weight heparin. Some centers advise this, as a blood thinner or in other words to improve the vascular or blood connections between mother and baby. It also prevents the rejection of the baby by the mothers body. Laser hatching is a method of using laser waves and thinning out or burning and making the outer coat of the embryo zona pellucida softer and thereby more susceptible to implantation. A thick zona is one of the causes of implantation failure. Normally this layer has to thin out on its own when it comes in contact with the inner lining of the uterus. This can be done for the blastocyst, so the chances of blastocyst implantation are very high. Blastocyst is better than eight-cell embryo implantation. The uterus does not know if this is the self of the donor egg. In ladies aged 41 years, they will try to overcome all possible causes of rejection.
Does ED mean donor embryo and OD mean  oocyte? Please check the abbreviation as we do not use that here. They can be used in the same sitting. Their phase of growth has to be the same, meaning two embryos of six to eight cells can be used, and not one eight-cell  another blastocyst.

"Hello doctor,
Four months post fusion surgery, I am having bilateral leg pain, burning sensations in legs down to feet, and nerve-like jolts in the left leg and numbness in toes and bottom feet. Wondering possibly arachnoiditis?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Spine and lower back surgery is a procedure that can have variable post operative outcomes. It is found that in approximately 40 percent of patients, the symptoms are completely relieved after surgery. In another 40 percent, the symptoms might show mild improvement. In 20 percent of patients, there is a minimal improvement and the pain might even worsen after surgery. The above is only an estimation and does not question the surgical skills of the surgeon in any way.
The problems with pain after surgery can be due to many reasons. It is possible that there is granulation tissue formed in the surgery area which is causing pressure on the nerve. Arachnoiditis is a less common complication and is likely only if there is a dural tear during the surgery. If your surgical notes do not mention any dural tear then arachnoiditis is unlikely. Usually, a repeat MRI magnetic resonance imaging spine of the involved area is required to know the cause of pain and burning in your case.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hi doctor,I have been taking Prozac for about six years. And I have noticed that my eye color looks much darker, I tried to research this online, but nothing came up apart from how Prozac can increase melanin melanocytes in the skin.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I hope you are otherwise hale and hearty. I have understood your query, and I would like to tell you that there is nothing really to be anxious about. Prozac or, generically, Fluoxetine can, in the long run, cause pigmentation of the skin. There have, however, been no or very few reports of it affecting the color of our eyes. What you may be experiencing could be just merely psychological, and in a rare instance, it could indeed be becoming darker. However, I would not worry about it as darker iris do not pose any medical risk, and I am pretty sure that the reason you are taking your Prozac Fluoxetine is far more important than the possible, rare, but very innocuous side effect. Although I must inform you that antipsychotics can at times cause blurring of vision or even glaucoma. Again these are rare but can turn serious. I would just recommend six months once or yearly checkup with your local eye doctor, and you should be good to go. Do not worry.

Suddenly, I have headaches starting from the back of my head until my shoulder. I have this headache often. It starts randomly without reason. I have gastric issues. Is this cause of my pain?","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
You seem to have two possibilities. You can have chronic GERD gastroesophageal reflux disease with LPR laryngopharyngeal reflux. Gastric acidic contents cause faulty reflux and this can be the reason for having a feeling of something stuck in your throat or itchy discomfort. Inflammation around the throat causes irritative cough. The other cause can be chronic allergic pharyngitis. It occurs due to exposure to some irritative substance. It irritates the throat causing intermittent cough. Avoid having exposure to irritative substances. Wear an N95 mask. Gastric issues have to be treated efficiently. Avoid having oily, spicy, and cold food. Avoid drinking alcohol and smoking for a month. Eat on time and take a soft digestible diet. Reduce your quantity of meals to half. Increase the frequency of your food intake but avoid overeating. Do not lie down or exercise immediately after taking meals. Keep a gap of atleast two hours. Maintain a left lateral position while lying down or sleeping. You can take syrup containing antacid. Take one tablespoon three times a day before 20 minutes of taking meals for two months. Along with this, you can take a proton pump inhibitor. You can take Pantoprazole 40 mg one tablet once a day before breakfast for a month. Do salt water gargling eight to ten times a day to wash out the irritative substance present in your throat. These measures will help you a lot.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,My serum creatinine level is 0.96 mgdL, urea 19 mmolL, spot urine microalbumin 42.9 mgL, spot urine creatinine 104.2 mgdL and the ratio is 41.1 mgdL. I would like to know if these values are normal or if there is something wrong with my kidneys.Kindly help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I read your query and can understand your concern.
Based on your laboratory test results, your creatinine level is within the normal range, which is between 0.6 and 1.2 mgdL for adults. Your urea level is also within the normal range, which is between 20 and 40 mgdL. Your spot urine microalbumin level is elevated at 42.9 mgL, which is higher than the normal range of less than 30 mgL. Microalbumin is a protein that is normally present in low amounts in urine, and an elevated level may be a sign of kidney damage or disease. Your spot urine creatinine level is also elevated at 104.2 mgdL, which is higher than the normal range of 44 to 133 mgdL for adults. Creatinine is a waste product that is produced by the muscles and eliminated by the kidneys. An elevated creatinine level may be a sign of kidney disease or impaired kidney function. Your ratio, which is calculated by dividing your spot urine microalbumin level by your spot urine creatinine level, is also elevated at 41.1 mgdL. This ratio can help determine whether your microalbuminuria is due to kidney disease or other factors, such as high blood pressure or diabetes. Based on these test results, it is possible that you may have kidney damage or disease. Your healthcare provider may recommend additional tests or monitoring to confirm the diagnosis and develop a treatment plan that meets your individual needs and circumstances. They may also recommend lifestyle changes, such as dietary modifications and exercise, to help manage your condition and prevent further damage to your kidneys.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have seen your reports attachments removed to protect patients identity. Based on the reports,
1. The hemoglobin is within the normal range. Compared to previous reports, the RBC count and platelets appear to have increased.
2. The RBCs red blood cells are smaller in size and increased in number. Smaller RBCs could be due to an early iron deficiency anemia. I suggest you use iron supplements. The increased number is a compensation to improve hemoglobin. Once the MCV mean corpuscular hemoglobin increases with iron therapy, the RBC count will reduce.
3. The platelet count is also slightly elevated. Is there any normal bleeding in the menstrual cycle? Is there gastritis? Even mild bleeding can cause an inverse increase in platelets. Also, a platelet count up to 4.5 lakhs is normal. If there is no bleeding, look for tar colored stools or blood in stools.
I suggest to repeat the tests after three months and take an  iron and vitamin C rich diet and supplements if necessary.

"Hello doctor,
I have constructed various inquiries regarding the skin on my body, and also, the skin on my scalp and face. I have observed several times that most botanical ingredients irritate my scalp, but these plant ingredients do not seem to irritate my face. I am highly cognizant that most plant ingredients are potential allergens. My question is, why is it that these plant ingredients only seem to affect my scalp negatively and not my face? I would also like to inform you that now, I typically avoid most plant ingredients, I read a plethora of information regarding cosmetics ingredients and skin science, and I also aim for products that have minimal ingredients. I predominately have sensitive skin. My second question is surrounding the IPL Kenzzi device that I invested in. A few weeks ago, I purchased an intense pulse light tool to slow the growth of unwanted hairs. The instructions state to shave everything, then to commence using the device for the first twelve weeks. After the first twelve weeks, then it states to use it twice a month, and then once a month I believe. When using the device for the second week, I noticed my skin reacted with rashes and dryness. So, my question is, should I continue the use of my device but just use it less often? Or, should I completely disregard it? Lastly, for a while now, I have noticed that I flake on the sides of my nose and my eyebrows. Could it possibly be seborrheic dermatitis? I did a colorless henna treatment for my scalp and hair but mostly my scalp a few weeks ago, and I have noticed that the flakes that would normally appear on my scalp have disappeared for quite a while now.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
First about botanical ingredients. As we know natural products are not necessarily allergy free  as they can contain oils and extracts from flowers, plants or nuts. Now as shampoos and facewash can have different botanical ingredients, that may be the reason your scalp is developing allergy but not your face. Now if same products are causing allergy to  scalp but not to face, then this may be due to the fact that scalp is more vascular and has many nerve endings. Now coming to IPL device, I need to ask you a few questions before providing any advise. Did you increase the energy during second session? Did this redness resolves in few days or is it persistent? Did you apply anything before doing IPL? Dryness is common after IPL treatment and sometimes temporary redness can occur. Third, yes it can be seborrheic dermatitis as in SD yellowish greasy scaling occurs on scalp, nose crease and eyebrows.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"

Mild hydrocephalus is possible at term and if the biparietal diameter on ultrasound is less than 10 cm then it is still fine. Ideally targeted scan can be done to check for any aqueductal stenosis congenitally, but it is unlikely. The size of the biparietal diameter should be monitored weekly with an ultrasound and by 39 weeks, delivery should be considered as  it is a breech presentation anyhow and unlikely that with hydrocephalus a normal vaginal delivery would be possible. There is no possibility of intrauterine intervention at present so any intervention if planned would be anyhow done after the delivery of the child. I hope I have answered your question.

Welcome to icliniq.com
I read your query and understand your concern. From what you have mentioned it appears that you have impaired fasting glucose. There is nothing to worry about but you have a probability of developing diabetes in the next six months to a year if you do not take good care of your health. Avoid sweet and sugars and sweet drinks as well. Have a low-carb diet and a low-fat diet. Have a good intake of water eight to ten glasses per day. Walk daily for 30 minutes gradually. Repeat your HBa1C after three months and get back to me and we will see whether the diet and exercise are working for you. I hope you find my advice helpful.

"Hello doctor,
I think I have had an adverse reaction to Invisalign retainers over the past few years. I think they have caused me jaw issues chronic facial tension radiating to all areas in my face and associated with droopy eyelids and jaw clicking and aberrant jaw positions, etc., and I can move this tension around with purposeful movements of facial muscles and pressure sensitivity on the face-tension is trapped, worsened, altered by glasses, pressure, and prescription and eye movements. I believe this began when I stopped wearing them 247 and particularly when I switched to wearing them every other night. I have noticed that my jaw is asymmetrical and perhaps small particularly on the RHS may be a link to why I was initially getting tension symptoms on the RHS so maybe Invisalign causes issues, stretches, small and asymmetric jaws excessively, or I have some random unexplained predisposition to my jaw getting confused by regularly changing bites or something still think the latter may have something to do with the former. I just wanted to inform you of this as I have been told these symptoms are unique, functional and although Invisalign is known to sometimes cause TMJ problems it is not heard of causing issues like this. I am open to suggestions. Thanks.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
The symptoms described by you are rarely caused by Invisalign, it may cause TMJ temporomandibular joint problems in some people but for a shorter duration as it is not permanent. Actually allergy means that you have redness in the area and if you wear for some time it cause some reactions in the local area and may also in the body. Do you have something like that? The symptoms are mostly related to TMJ, the reason may be that you can not bite on your teeth and you are now biting on Invisalign, and this can increase your bite where it normally was. The best in my opinion will be to consult your orthodontist if you can pause your treatment. Stop wearing Invisalign, rest your jaw for as long as you can like do not eat hard or crunchy or sticky food. Soft diet, no prolong talking, do not open wide too much especially yawning. Also, use over the counter pain killer for relief.

"Hello doctor,
I got an RPE on my upper jaw a few days back, and I have been puking for days since that. It has nothing with my diet, and I even went to a doctor. The feeling of the device on my tongue gets me nauseous and sick every day. I am not sure as to what I should do.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern. A rapid palatal expander RPE is a device placed on the upper jaw to expand the upper palatal bone with a key that needs to be rotated at fixed intervals. As you mentioned about the pukish feeling, I would like to know a few more details. Are you having an enhanced gag reflex do you feel pukish when any foreign item goes towards the end of your mouth? Was the feeling of nauseousness present since the beginning when the RPE was placed, or did it develop later on? Did you notice any shift in RPE from the original position? Could you share a picture of your upper jaw with the RPE so that I can evaluate the position of the expander? Sometimes, it takes a few days to adjust to the new object in the mouth. If there is any change in the mouth, the extra sensitive tongue will always go towards that area. Another reason could be that the RPE was placed without the proper height causing the tongue to hit it frequently, causing nausea. The RPE could have been placed more posteriorly towards the soft palate, causing the gag reflex. If RPE was positioned correctly, the nauseousness could be because you have an extra sensitive soft palate and tongue. Please share more information on the questions mentioned and a few clear pictures for better assessment and to provide you with the best possible advice. Do add on any further queries or ask for information required, and I will answer them.

He had felt cold at midnight  and when he woke up, they found his right hand and leg were not working properly.
He can feel everything, he can also move both legs and hands, but feels lack of power in the right hand and leg.
He is not able to walk and not able to drink water.

They visited an ayurvedic doctor this morning and he has given some ayurvedic medicne and nurokind plus injection 2mL once daily.
Please suggest the right treatment.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
If your father had presented to me as an outpatient, I would have immediately taken him for a NCCT Head CT scan of brain as this is likely a case of stroke.
Ayurvedic medicines and nurokind will not help at this stage.
Immediately, get a CT scan of head done.
In the CT scan, if there is no hemorrhage bleeding, that means if hemorrhage is ruled out, he should immediately be put on tablet Ecosprin 150mg per day and tablet Atorvastatin 20mg per day.
But, if hemorrhage is detected, these medicines must not be given as these can increase the size of hemorrhage.
So, hemorrhage should be ruled out first.
Physiotherapy should be started for the weak limbs.
It may take months to recover.
Best thing is to get a CT scan head done and share the reports as soon as possible. Delay should be avoided. Also provide the below details
1 Is he a smoker?
2 Does he have diabetes, high blood pressure or heart disease?
3 How many hours have passed since he developed this weakness?

"Hello doctor,I have undergone right ectopic salpingectomy and got removed one of my fallopian tubes 16 years ago. After a lot of medicines and treatment, one boy child was born to me after two years. After that, I was diagnosed with polycystic ovary disease PCOD. Now I want to have another baby and I am 35 years old. Can I straight away go for IVF in vitro fertilization procedure?Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome back to icliniq.com.
I read your query and understand your concern.
Hope you are doing fine. Now if age is a factor that is making you ask for an IVF in vitro fertilization procedure, you can go for it directly. The best age for a lady to get pregnant is 19 to 35 yrs. You have reached the upper limit and it would not be advisable to try your luck with normal methods for long. Once the eggs in your ovaries get over, there is no treatment to get them back and even the IVF in vitro fertilization procedure may not be possible after a particular age. There is no such fixed age after which pregnancys chance is low, as the oldest mother in the world is 45 years old. My own patient had a triplet pregnancy at the age of 41 years after a few hormonal injections. If you want to try otherwise, that can be done for a few more months. Since you have one tube and could have a pregnancy through that, then there is a good chance for you to conceive through the same tube again. For the diagnosis of PCOD polycystic ovary disease, your weight has to be corrected.
PCOD Polycystic ovary syndrome This is a congenital condition, I mean it is a genetically programmed condition, you get it from your parents. When you suddenly put on weight, this cholesterol is converted into estrogen hormone if I may simulate-have not you seen obese men developing breasts and in young obese girls, who develop periods at a younger age - they all have high levels of estrogen hormone or female hormone. In your body too when fat, which is stored for tomorrow, is more than normal, then it is converted into a hormone that tips the balance between FSH follicle stimulating hormone from the brain and the ovarian hormone. FSH follicle stimulating hormone as the name suggests stimulates follicles from the ovary, but once the follicle is big enough to ovulate, the FSH follicle stimulating hormone is suppressed by the same estrogen hormone from the ovary. But when the same estrogen hormone is coming from fat, the brain is confused and follicle growth stops early at a smaller follicle size and will not rupture, next scan you will see all these follicles as polycystic ovaries. This is usually associated with obesity, irregular menstrual cycles, no periods for a few months, and later heavy periods with clots and fleshy masses, spotting on and off, thyroid abnormality, and prolactin problem indirectly. You develop that extra pad of fat around the mid-segment of the body, especially the waist, thighs, and breasts, with no fat beyond the elbow and knees. Excessive body hair growth, hair fall, a dark shade over the lower half of the face, acne, oily face skin, black skin over the back of the neck, inner thighs, and under the surface of the breast. May have a family history of diabetes, especially father or his family. This will not allow ovulation to occur at any time and so you cannot get pregnant, till it is treated. It also increases your chances of early pregnancy abortions. But this has a solution.
Your weight has to be
Weight in kg Height in cm - 100
Your expected weight is 52 to 57 kg 121 to 126 lbs. Once you reduce weight to the normal range, you would not need any medicine to get periods or to get pregnant and pregnancy will be healthy.
To reduce weight follow the following tips
No junk food or fast food or red meat, reduce snacks in between meals.
Have low calories food and high proteins.
Regular exercise especially for the waist and hip area, aerobics, yoga, brisk walking swing your hands well, try to reduce five to eight pounds per month.
Do not hurry on weight reduction, it will be difficult to maintain. As soon as you reduce at least 10 pounds of weight, you will see changes.
Kindly see if the following checklist of investigations is done
Husband- Semen analysis at least to be done four weeks apart preferably in an infertility center examination done by an andrologist, blood sugar level.
Wife - Blood sugar levels, thyroid profile.
Ultrasound scans evaluate the uterus, ovaries, and adnexa adnexa is the group of ovaries, fallopian tubes, and ligaments that secure the female reproductive organs.
Confirm tubal patency- It is the most important Tube is the connection between the uterus and ovaries, the bridge where sperm meets the egg and forms a baby. It is the size of the hair follicle and cannot be seen on scans. It is such a small opening tube that it can get blocked easily.
Check with HSG hysterosalpingography, which is an x-ray taken with a dye, or SSG sonosalpingography which is a scan with a dye, or laparoscopy only one tube is left, once you had gotten pregnant, does not mean the tube is still open, it may be blocked by small mucous plug or adhesions, so on.
If all this is done and found normal, nothing can stop a pregnancy with Gods will. So I would advise, reducing weight by a few pounds this will improve the eggs response be it normal or hormonal injections or IVF-in vitro fertilization, once weight starts reducing, have your fallopian tube tested. If the remaining tube is also blocked, go directly for IVF in vitro fertilization, but if the tube is still open, give it four to six months.  Try with normal methods or better with hormonal injections with or without IUI-intrauterine insemination a simpler method with four times the pregnancy chances, cheaper, and it is not IVF-in vitro fertilization.
Hope I have cleared your query, do write back if any more queries.
All the best.

"Hi doctor,I have enlarged prostate, urinary retention, and hematuria for almost a year. I had MRI of prostate done. I would like to have the interpretation of images. Currently, I am on Flowmax and Finasteride.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
The MRI scan of the prostate attachment removed to protect patient identity shows a grossly enlarged prostate which is indenting the lumen of the urinary bladder and which you are probably aware of. Further, the median lobe of the prostate is showing hypertrophy and projecting into the base of the urinary bladder area.
The volume of the urinary bladder is significantly decreased and I can see that there is circumferential wall thickening of the urinary bladder. This can mean that the enlarged prostate has been causing bladder outlet obstruction and that is leading to retention of urine and infection. There are no obvious features of prostate cancer on T2 and diffusion images. There is no area of strikingly abnormal enhancement.
I would interpret the findings to be due to gross enlargement of the prostate and causing bladder outlet obstruction causing urinary bladder wall infection.

"Hi doctor,
I suffer from agoraphobia, and getting out is difficult for me, but my stomach problems have worsened this condition. It has now got to the point that I am scared to eat anything hours before I go out as I am so concerned about losing control of my bowels with diarrhea which has happened before. After that, I am frightened to eat anything at all. I have diarrhea often, and it comes on suddenly without warning. I usually run to the toilet, so I do not want to be in any place where there is no toilet. I have tried cutting everything out of my diet and making different changes, but nothing works.
My stomach hurts very often. This problem started around 20 years ago. My GP sent me to a gastroenterologist at the hospital. The doctor there asked me a few questions and recommended fiber supplements and an SSRI as he diagnosed IBS. Unfortunately, the supplement went straight through me, and the SSRI caused panic attacks leading to the development of the panic disorder. So it often happens that after having a meal, and within five minutes to one hour, I will have to run to the toilet. It is almost always very loose bowel movements or diarrhea, but the stools are often very yellow. But the urge to go to the toilet is sudden and immediate. I have mistaken this sensation for gas and bloating in the past and tried to pass gas, resulting in me soiling myself, but I do not know if this is psychological as I am so concerned about diarrhea.
I have been asking my GP about this for 20 years, and they tell me it is happening because I am anxious or that it could be due to the other medications I take. So I reported all the events to my GP two months ago again. He said to try the IBS drug Mebeverine. But this has not helped too. So I went to another GP, and they did some blood tests which I shall attach. After looking at the results, they increased my Atorvastatin from 20 mg to 80 mg.
My cholesterol and triglycerides have always been high, so are my mothers and my grandfathers. So the plan at the moment is to tackle this problem with the increased 80 mg of Atorvastatin. For around 20 years, I mostly had loose bowels, sudden urgency to go toilet, fecal incontinence, and episodes of stomach pain. However, I am trying to lose weight. I am often exercising and concentrating on cardio workouts. It is hard to go out to exercise when you have constant loose bowels and you are frightened to be away from a toilet. The doctors want me to improve my diet, but if I eat fruits, vegetables, legumes, oats, or wheat, I run to the toilet.
I have asked my GP if this could be bile acid malabsorption, and they have told me that this is all due to my weight and medication. But that cannot be true as this has been happening for 20 years. It happened to me when I was 80 kg and at 130 kg. It happened before I was on these current medications that I take,
1. Tablet Pregabalin 300 mg twice daily.
2. Tablet Atorvastatin was 20 mg daily, raised to 80 mg.
3. Tablet Escitalopram 10 mg once daily.
4. Tablet Mebeverine 135 mg thrice daily.
5. Tablet Mirtazapine 30 mg once daily.
6. Tablet Propranolol 40 mg once daily.
7. Tablet Quetiapine 25 mg once daily.
I have also taken SSRIs and Benzodiazepines in the past.
So is there anything you can suggest? Is there anything obvious that appears to you? I cannot even go to the local hospital to visit a specialist anymore, as my agoraphobia is so bad now. Leaving my street sometimes is impossible, and all consultations with my GPs are now over the phone.
Is there anything you can suggest for me?
Please help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I went through your query and understood your concern.
I have seen your reports attachment removed to protect the patients identity. So I think a few issues are related to your case. First, I agree with the diagnosis of IBS irritable bowel syndrome because you have a change in the bowel movement BM- number and consistency, and the pain, which is a spasm type of pain, leads you to rush to the toilet and no severe findings such as weight loss. In fact, you have been gaining weight.
Secondly, stomach pain is constant, which is secondary to another condition called epigastric pain syndrome or functional dyspepsia. The latter is commonly associated with irritable bowel syndrome. I have reviewed your medication, and I think we need to make a few modifications. First, I suggest you to stop taking the tablet Escitalopram antidepressant and replace it with the tablet Tryptinol Amitriptyline 25 mg at night daily. Take this medication for at least two to four weeks to see a response in your bowel movements and stomach pain.
Other problems, like cholesterol, borderline sugar, obesity, and fatty liver, can aggravate the symptoms of IBS. The best approach would be to exercise and reduce your weight. Since you have all the important investigations, I suggest you do a stool test to diagnose pancreatic insufficiency pancreatic elastase in stool, which can be associated with IBS and your raised triglycerides level. In addition, I suggest you to undergo an endoscopy and colonoscopy to see inside your gut.
The dose of Tryptinol can be increased if the modifications mentioned above are not effective in four weeks.
Kindly consult a specialist, talk with them and take the medications with their consent.
I hope this has helped you.

Usually, OCD obsessive-compulsive disorder responds well to medicines, but in some cases, only a partial response is achieved. There is a therapy called cognitive behavioral therapy which is very effective and useful in chronic, partially responsive OCD.

Yes, you are right. It has to be repaired. If you do not have a problem in defecation, then you can wait for some time. But, after repair, you have to take rest for at least three months and you cannot ride horses until then. Healing will complete by three months time and you have to wait for three months or more according to your age and other blood status.

"Hi doctor,
I ate some shrimp and pork dumplings for dinner about a week ago. At night, I got woken up by severe pain in my lower abdomen, I took some Ibuprofen, and the pain went away. On the next day, I started to feel nausea. This lasted for a few days without any other symptoms. On the sixth day, I took some herbal medicine that helped with nausea. Now I feel bloated, gas medicine does not seem to help, I have been urinating more often, and my mouth is dry. What should I do?","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
It looks like some stomach infection. But I would recommend you get your blood sugar test done to be sure if you do not have diabetes. For stomach infection, I would suggest you discuss with your doctor and take Tablet Rifaximin antibiotic 400 mg twice daily for five days along with a combination of Pantoprazole proton pump inhibitor and Levosulpiride antipsychotic. This should help you with the problem.
Please let me know if you have any loose stools, weight loss, thyroid, or diabetes issues.
I hope it helps you.","{'score': 87, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 7, 'transparency': 8}","{'score': 85, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 5, 'transparency': 8}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hi doctor,
I am experiencing period pains but my back hurts severely and my uterus feels like it is being cut.  I have a headache but it feels like there is a lot of tension on my forehead and my eyes are throbbing.
What would you recommend I take for the pain?
Thank you.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I can suggest some general tips that may help you feel more comfortable
Heat therapy Applying heat to your lower abdomen or lower back can help relieve the pain. You can use a hot water bottle or a heating pad. If you do not have any of those, a warm towel or a warm bath can also be helpful.
Over-the-counter pain relievers Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs such as Ibuprofen and Naproxen can help relieve menstrual pain. Please note that following the recommended dosage is essential, and you should not take NSAIDs if you have a history of stomach ulcers or bleeding disorders.You can go ahead and take Ibuprofen as and when needed. Consult with your doctor and take the medicine with consent.
Gentle exercise Light exercise like walking, stretching, or yoga can help reduce menstrual pain.
Relaxation techniques Try to find ways to relax and reduce stress. Meditation, deep breathing exercises, or listening to calming music can help.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Nasal congestion is aggravated by polyps as they cause blocked nasal pathways mechanically. Endoscopy is necessary to understand at what extent the polyps are enlarged to decide for the best treatment strategy. Mucus is trapped and should be on its way to get cleared. But polyps are making it difficult. So continue medication as prescribed and run endoscopy as suggested.

"Hello doctor,
I noticed a white cloudy area around the rim of my cornea a couple of days ago with no pain. After a couple of days, I used a rigid gas permeable contact wear. I have now woken up with pain in the same eye and it is now bloodshot around that one side. I decided not to wear the contacts today and I have worn the glasses only. I visited my optometrist and he has prescribed a steroid drop. I am looking for a second opinion. Of note, I have worn glasses for 25 years. I have used the RGP lenses for 12 years. Had a white patch on the edge of the cornea approximately five years back. This was attributed to contact irritation and healed after a few weeks of not wearing RGPs. Please advice.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
This is a corneal ulcer. The probable cause is trauma due to lenses or infected contact lens solution. Please do not use the steroid drop. You can have devastating consequences. The steroid drops will give you very mild relief but it will stop healing and promote the growth of the ulcer. Investigations to be done include cultures of lenses and its solution. You should refrain from wearing the contacts in future. I suggest you use spectacles only. I suggest you take the following. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and with their consent take the following medicines. Start Moxifloxacin eye drops six times a day. Start Tobramycin eye drops four times a day. Start Carboxymethylcellulose plus Naphazoline eye drops 10 to 12 times a day. Start Homatropine eye drop twice daily. This will cause blurred vision but will give relief. Start Gatifloxacin eye ointment at bedtime. Have this treatment until the ulcer heals completely. Visit an ophthalmologist.

"Hi doctor,
I am a 23 year old female diagnosed with UTI before six months back and took antibiotics. But I still have mild weird symptoms until today. I tested it again and did more than ten urine tests with culture during these six months. I felt that there is something wrong. But there is no sign of infection and the doctor told me that there is nothing wrong with me. I do not feel like peeing. But I used to pee with burning sometimes and I have abnormal symptoms. I am confused and do not know what to do. I drink around one liter of water and I will have a bottle of water wherever I go. I usually go to the bathroom when I wake up and I use to have four to six-bathroom trips throughout the day. But I have burning spasms whenever I pee. They really cause burning. I have a lot of burning spasms while going on the first trip.
The burning reduces after the second and third trips. When I rush to the bathroom after a burning spasm, I have concentrated urine and it burns a lot. When I finish passing the concentrated urine, my urethra seems to be inflamed and the irritation goes away after ten minutes. This happens once a day or twice and now it is frequent. Sometimes, the bladder spasm is normal and they do not cause burning. Rarely, I have normal spasms and my pee seems to be clear. I feel like my bladder is sending me signals with these burning spasms. I am dealing with this problem for six months and I tried chugging water. It worked for me and sometimes it did not help me. It makes me to have constant pee.
At that time, I stopped doing it and reduce my water intake. I feel normal for few hours and sometimes my urine becomes concentrated and it burns a lot. I do not have burning spasms while sleeping and it is present only when I wake up. I do not drink coffee and alcohol. I do not smoke and I take a reduced amount of salt in my food. I have tried everything. I do not know the reason for having this problem. I want to pee normally without any burning sensation as going to the bathroom became a nightmare for me.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
There are two main issues and it can cause problems. The first one is interstitial cystitis. It causes chronic inflammation of the bladder with pain during filling of the bladder and pain goes away when the urine is passed. You can do cystoscopy and bladder biopsy. Then treatment can be taken if the biopsy is positive. The other cause is overactive bladder spasm and contraction of the bladder during filling and giving a sensation for a toilet. Often it can be diagnosed by doing a urodynamic study and treatment can be started after confirming the diagnosis.
The other causes can be bladder stone or tumor. You need to do an ultrasound KUB renal ultrasound to check your urinary system. Then you need to have a bladder diary for three days in which you need to mention the urine passed throughout the day and the time taken for it for three days. You can start taking tablet Tolterodine 10 mg once daily and it reduces the frequency. It relaxes bladder muscles to avoid spasms and increases bladder capacity. These issues have to be solved by step by step approach. Please have a follow up after doing an ultrasound and a bladder diary.","{'score': 93, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

"Hello doctor,
I am a 24-year-old male. I am a dental student, and I suffered  from clinical  depression five years ago. I consulted a psychiatrist,  and since then I was on antidepressant Sertraline,  antipsychotic Aripiprazole, and Divalproex. Three years after the treatment when the symptoms  subsided, the medication  was reduced  to only Divalproex,  but due to some stress, Aripiprazole was started again. Then after some time again due to stress I lost my confidence  and started feeling  social phobia so Escitalopram  was started. The reason I think behind  this depression  is my academic  failure and bullying I suffered  during my childhood.
I feel normal on taking medications. But my query is that how long I have to take these medicines? Will it terminate and what can I do other than medications  to overcome this situation?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
It is good to know that you are able to function well at present and medication has been helpful. I note that you are currently on Escitalopram, Aripiprazole, and Divalproex. You have reported suffering from clinical depression, stress, and social phobia. Since you experienced some sort of relapse when Aripiprazole and Sertraline were stopped, it is advisable to continue the current regimen. Check with your psychiatrist about the exact diagnosis as in some types of affective disorder, mood stabilizer may need to be continued for a longer period duration depends on individual circumstances, nature of depression, associated symptoms like mood instability, thought, and perceptual disturbances, etc..  Patients need to be on medication for at least some years to minimize chances of relapse.
You can try CBT cognitive behavioral therapy or psychological therapy to help you manage your condition better and prevent relapse. Also, learn stress management  techniques.  You can try yoga, regular exercise, and develop good social relationships, etc. Have regular follow-ups with your psychiatrist.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Masturbation is a safe habit and it does not cause any serious effects on health. Masturbation is not a cause for the reduced size of the penis. Size of penis remains constant and it never decreases. If you are seeing any reduction in size, then that is due to psychological reasons. If you have a normal erection then no need to get worried. Size has no roles in sexual intercourse. Jelqing is an exercise that can help in improving the size. You can think of trying this. This involves milking like repetitive action in a semi-erected penis. This will help in improving the size of the penis to some extent.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 97, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"

"Hello doctor,
I have been suffering from what I think are mental problems since last year. To give you some context, I went abroad for studies, and I felt extremely lonely and miserable there. After a year, I was suffering from sleep problems. However, one day, I had confusing thoughts, just before I went to sleep. For some reason, I became convinced that I had a mental illness, and I began researching my symptoms. My condition also declined. I began to feel detached from everyone and everything around me, and I felt like I was losing touch with reality. This went on for some months. However, during this time, I felt fine when I was in the company of others, and therefore longed to be with people and talk to them.I gave my exams, even rejoined a job, which I had left to do my masters. There are periods when I feel completely fine. But, there are periods when I feel terrible. I am having the following symptoms. Whatever dreams I have, I tend to remember and notice them more. I could be dreaming about my old house or someone. So when I wake up, these dreams cause me to feel uncomfortable, like maybe I will lose my grip on reality. Whenever I see or meet a person I have dreamt about, I get an uncomfortable, unpleasant feeling and a memory of the dream. This makes me afraid that maybe I will be unable to distinguish between dreams and reality.
I get mental images and thoughts of memories or things I dreamt about. This gives a very unpleasant feeling. For the past few days, I am getting strong mental images of faces of people whenever I talk to them or think about them or see them. For instance, I would be thinking of someone, and I will have a strong mental image of their face. I would be talking to someone, and a different mental image of their face would pop up. I am really scared about this. Why am I getting mental images of everything like this? I feel depressed and sad that I will lose control, and that I will go crazy. At times, I am confused and not able to process things properly. I have also started feeling scared and petrified for no reason. I get a sinking and nervous feeling in my chest. My hands shake at times, and I feel like I will lose control. This has been happening for the past 10 months. Are my worst fears true? Do I have a mental illness?","Hi,

"Hello doctor,I had what I believe was the flu. It started end of last month. I got mostly better, still had post nasal drip and persistent weakness. Got a worsened sore throat this week. I went to urgent care as I am traveling and was given Amoxi 875 for 10 days. Strep was negative. Lungs were clear. Throat clearing with the antibiotic but I am still weak. Is this normal or should I be concerned? By weak I mean, I do not really feel well after doing things like shower, grocery store for supplies, etc. I am not short of breath, just a little weak and shaky. How long after the flu am I safe from deadly pneumonia?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
From what you mentioned, you have experienced upper respiratory infection and you received appropriate therapy of antibiotics. Post-nasal drip is common after upper respiratory infection and will resolve over time gradually.
Regarding pneumonia, you should not worry about it as you have no symptoms like high fever, rapid breathing or wet cough with dark phlegm, also your chest X-ray is free as you mentioned.
Your weakness is most likely myalgia which accompanies the infection. It will improve within days.
Have you performed CBC blood tests?
I suggest

"Hi doctor,
I am having 2-month-old baby. Since two days I am observing that his diapers are not wet and heavy as they used to be. So I checked his urine output by laying him down without a diaper for five hours and fed him twice with two and a half hours gap between each feed. He peed thrice after the first feed with 20 minutes gap and he did not pee until he had his second feed. After the second feed, he peed thrice with 20 to 30 minutes gap.
Recently, I have reduced his feeding amount on pediatrician advice as he was vomiting. I used to feed him up to 3.33 oz with 3 to 4 hours gap and now I am feeding him 2 to 2.3 oz with 2.5 hours gap. I am exclusively expressing milk and feeding through the bottle and sometimes on formula. He is having motion 3 to 4 times per day. Please advise me if this is normal since I feel that his urine has decreased compared to previously. His weight is 9.92 lbs checked 20 days before.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern for your baby. Your baby should urinate 6 to 8 times per day. As you have told that the baby peed after feeds, this seems absolutely normal. You may just keep a track on total 24 hours urine. Should be 6 to 8 times in a day. Reducing feed amount is fine but feed every 2 to 3 hourly and on-demand feeding.
Why are you not breastfeeding? Is there any problem? If it is there, it should be addressed. The bottle feeds increase the risk of infection. The stools 3 to 4 times is normal. Weight is 9.92 lbs, it is a good weight but need to know the birth weight. Then only would be able to know whether adequate weight gain is there or not. And also the present weight, if you know.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hi doctor,
When I was 15 years old, I had a bilateral pulmonary embolism with no known causation. I was wondering about my options for pregnancy in the future, rather, if it would be an option. I am currently taking Apixaban twice daily, and I am unsure of when I will stop taking it. My clots have now dissolved, and I am doing alright. This may be a difficult question to answer, but I am curious nonetheless.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Happy to hear that you are doing well and it is very wise to be concerned about your future pregnancy. So let me outline a few things for you. Pregnancy itself is a state in which blood clots more than in a non-pregnant person. This is due to an increase in  progesterone and estrogen during pregnancy. Since you are high risk for clotting disorders due to your history of pulmonary embolism PE your chances of clots forming in your legs DVT and lung again PE  during pregnancy is increased by many folds. This puts you in high risk pregnancy category, which means even if you can get pregnant, it has to be planned and  monitored very closely. During pregnancy, you will be started on low molecular weight heparin to prevent clotting and blood parameters like bleeding and clotting time, INR will be monitored. Let all this not worry you. Apixaban is toxic to pregnancy, hence contraception and prevention of pregnancy until the time you are on this drug is advised. So when you plan to get pregnant, prenatal counseling by a gynecologist  and this drug switched to a safer pregnancy alternative. All this said and done, if you take the appropriate care and medication you can have a safe and uneventful pregnancy.
I hope this helps.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"

"Hello doctor,
I got the influenza vaccination about a week ago and have a swollen and painful lump in my armpit.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern. You are having lymph node swelling axillary post influenza vaccination. Influenza vaccine is a very safe vaccine. Although some may have local pain, swelling, and fever. Some may have local lymphadenopathy.
Lymphadenopathy is a swelling of lymph node normal gland present in our body, which function as clearing harmful substances and providing immunity. Local and systemic reactions mostly began between day 1 and day 2.
When a lymph node rapidly increases in size, its capsule stretches and causes pain. Pain is usually the result of an inflammatory process. It is a reactive response of the lymph node to the vaccination. So no need to worry.
It can be managed by simple Paracetamol or anti-inflammatory medication such as Serratiopeptidase. It should resolve within a week. If it is associated with fever or any other site enlargement of lymph node you can visit your physician.

"Hello doctor,
My wife was operated for carcinoma cervix seven years back. No CCRT was given. Four years later, it was relapsed. 22 RT and 5 CT were given. Presently she is under regular follow up. For last two years, she has severe abdomen discomfort, crampy pain, and abdomen fullness. Due to all these, she is taking hardly her meal.

I bought a trainer watch to monitor my bpm and calories burned because I started exercising at home by doing fast dancing. I am 36, height 51, and weigh 150 lbs. My goal is to lose 20 pounds in two months. I have done two days of workout, and the calories I have burned are the following Day One 1.07 hours of workout shows I burned 907 calories. Day two 50 min workout shows I burned 700 calories. The trainer said that if I wanted to be generous to shave off 100 from that, I would technically burn 807 and 600 calories if I do. I have a friend that works out who states that those numbers are unrealistic and that it is impossible to burn so much. I make salsa, merengue, and soca music, which are all fast. Are the numbers that unrealistic? I feel great after the workouts, I sweat a lot, and I am getting my energy back, which ultimately matters, but I do want to burn calories.","Hi,

On average, a woman needs 2000 calories intake in a day if you minus the energy expenditure by your daily work out 1400 calories, that is pretty good but if you mean you are aiming to lose weight, then work out and diet have to go hand in hand, I want to congratulate you that you are doing an excellent job by working out and burning calories. However, I wish to suggest you, for dynamic visual change in your body weight, start consuming a protein diet, like the white egg in breakfast, lunch, more boiled or grilled chicken and fish. Carbohydrates consumption should be only two percent per day negligible, avoiding sugar. Diet contributes more than exercise your body is what you eat.

"Hello doctor,
Can I swim while wearing a contact lens? I am looking to connect with an eye doctor who can give advice or insight on this.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Contact lenses should never be used while swimming. Contact lenses should never come in contact with water and patients are educated to never use water to clean or store lenses.   Some people feel that wearing lenses underwater can help them see better, this thought could perhaps have come in the mind of a professional swimmer or coach. But unfortunately wearing contact lenses will not improve vision underwater. The reason for this being that the eye is designed to work on the basis of a difference in the refractive index. To put it in a simple way, the difference in the refractive index between the eye and air is large, hence vision is clear, whereas the difference in refractive index is very small between our eye and water, thus leading to blurred vision. The only way to see clearly underwater is by using watertight swimming goggles, which have a layer of air in front of the eye, thus bringing back the difference in the refractive index. Swimmers with the refractive error may use contact lenses with their swimming goggles. Coming to the harmful effects of contact lens usage in water, the most important being bacterial infections of the cornea, called keratitis. The commonest organism being pseudomonas. Pseudomonas is a very prolific bacteria, this organism is the bane of every ophthalmologist thanks to a special trait it exhibits of boring through an intact and healthy cornea setting up deep-seated hard to cure diseases. The most characteristic organism seen would be acanthamoeba, this organism is ubiquitous and infects untreated swimming pools and many natural water sources like rivers, tanks, lakes, etc., in which people swim in during hiking and outdoor activities. All causes of such a corneal ulcer will need emergency hospital admission and treatment with intensive monitoring for signs of recovery. If at all you are interested in wearing lenses while swimming, the best option would be to use daily disposable lenses which can be disposed after swimming. Rigid lenses mostly will slip off the eye while swimming. Soft lenses usually are retained in the eye but will absorb most of the bacteria, chemicals like chlorine, etc., used for treating the water. This can set up a lot of inflammation and cause redness, irritation and blurred vision.   To conclude, I would say that wearing lenses underwater will not help you see well. This blurring underwater can be overcome by wearing swimming goggles, but not by contact lenses. Contact lens use while swimming will only cause serious eye problems and is to be best avoided.","{'score': 92, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 89, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 7, 'transparency': 8}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hi doctor,
I am an 18-year-old male. Three years ago, a dog slightly bit my hand. The dog died 1.5 years after he bit me. It has been three years now, but I am worried as I heard that rabies appears after years. I did not take any medicine then. I ignored it because it was a pet dog. If I take anti-rabies vaccine or boosters now, will it protect me? The dog was my neighbors pet dog.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your worry with this situation as rabies is considered dangerous.
The good news is that the dog that bit you probably did not have rabies as the progression of this disease is fast in dogs. If a rabid dog bites you, it will die in weeks. As you mentioned that the dog died after 1.5 years, I would not consider it rabid, and I think your health is at no risk due to that incident.
Keep in mind that if this ever happens again with a pet dog, the best action is for the dog to be monitored by a veterinarian for signs of rabies. If the dog that bites a person is a wild dog, it should be caught and taken to the vet to get tested, and if the wild dog is unavailable, this warrants taking prophylactic rabies vaccines. The bottom line is, always consult your physician immediately after a dog bite.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have seen your query about bleeding in the middle of your period. You have a regular 30 days cycle which means your ovulation day is on the 16th day of the period. Your last period was before two months, which makes the next ovulation day on the first week of this month, which is away from your days of sex last day of the previous month and first day of this month. It is impossible to fertilize eight days before the day of ovulation and unlikely to be implantation bleeding. Your period is prolonged because of the affected proliferative phases of menstruation. The best time to test for pregnancy is today. If it turns to be negative, you are not pregnant for that intercourse and this period.

Kindly help.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
What kind of kidney problem is your son having? I went through the data provided by you attachments removed to protect the patients identity. He has a considerably higher level of hemoglobin. His blood pressure is also an effect of high hemoglobin.
Elevated hemoglobin is seen in smokers, people living at high altitudes, congestive cardiac failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, erythropoietin secreting adenomas of kidney, high oxygen affinity hemoglobin, rarely hereditary autosomal recessive erythrocytosis, and very rarely it could be a part of primary polycythemia. If all the causes are excluded, get JAK2 Janus kinase 2 mutations test, exon 12, and CALR calreticulin mutations tested.
In case of secondary polycythemia, the treatment of elevated hemoglobin is to treat the cause. In primary polycythemia, if JAK 2 is negative, the treatment is therapeutic phlebotomy or venesection. The goal is to keep hemoglobin and hematocrit within the range for males, less than 50 hematocrits, and for a female, less than 48. And hemoglobin in males is up to 16 gdL and for females up to 15 gdL. Repeated venesections or phlebotomies can lead to micronutrient deficiency, especially deficiency of iron. The patient should be given micronutrient replacement therapy. For JAK 2 positive patients, tablet Ruxolitinib are delivered in a dose of 5 to 15 mg per day. Another option is IFN-alpha immune interferon in a low dose of 45 ug for a week in both JAK 2 positive or negative cases. CALR positive cases show superior results on this model. It could take years to cure the disease.
Meanwhile, along with all therapeutic modalities, thrombophilia prophylaxis is given. This is not a life-threatening disease. The patient can die with this but does not die of it.
I hope this would help.

With medication, I conceived naturally and had a successful pregnancy. I am now pregnant again unplanned and am 7 weeks  3. I had some spotting and cramping three days ago. The spotting was light and stopped within a few hours. The cramping continued for another day. Blood hCG levels are rising very well and are currently over 83,000. A transvaginal scan yesterday showed the heartbeat and we were told all is well. Today, I had some light spotting dark brown and discomfort and passed a brown clot. My query is whether this may have been the cause of the spotting the other day, or maybe this was caused by irritation from the TV scan yesterday. I am concerned anyway and any advice would be greatly appreciated. Current medications Eltroxin, Prednisolone 5 mcg, Clexane. Starting intralipids next week to target NK cells.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern. From your history, I do not see any reason for you to worry. This spotting could be from mild erosion on surface of the cervix, which may bleed spontaneously or during sex or due to scan probe. In your history as you have not mentioned pain, I can say for sure that there is no intrauterine blood. Scan also did not pick any hemorrhages attachment removed to protect patient identity. The medications you are having is absolutely the perfect ones. Most of the miscarriages before 12 weeks are due to genetic problems. But in the present scan as babys growth has been adequate, you do not need to worry. This clot could be an implantation bleed. This is normal and nothing needs to be done.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 95, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,
I have swollen lymph in my neck for the past two months, dry cough for three months, on and off a fever in the evening, headache, vague, abdominal pain and muscle pain.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Thanks for your query and I understand your concerns. Persistent swollen lymph node requires tissue biopsy sampling as it could represent serious conditions especially if painless. Can you estimate the size? Is it painful? Is it single or multiple? The possible causes are TB tuberculosis, chronic infection, lymphoma and other blood diseases.
Please provide me with more details and send me the investigations to narrow the differentials. For further advice, please do not hesitate to follow up.

"Hi doctor,
I was taking 50 mg Thyroxine for TSH value- 11 thyroids in 15 days, and it has dropped to 3.47, and I have not been taking the dose for a week, yet my palpitation and sleeplessness continue What should I do? Should I start with a lower amount? How to cure the palpitation? I started with the thyroid medicine because I started having irregular periods and was made to get checked by a gynecologist. I have had thyroid before but not for very long I used to take homeopathy medicine, and because of that, my thyroid used to fluctuate, but I never had a severe problem. However, my mother had thyroid many years ago, and her TSH levels were not very high. It was only seven.
Please help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern.
I just read your query and saw your reports the attachments are removed to protect the patients identity. You have hypothyroidism.  The dose of thyroid medicine is appropriate according to your body weight, and previous TSH thyroid stimulating hormone levels were relatively high, so you needed to take this medicine.  There are certain things that you must keep in mind while you take thyroid medication for hypothyroidism.
1. Do not take any homeopathic medication to worsen your thyroid function.
2. Do not take caffeine or caffeinated drinks some cold beverages also contain caffeine, as it can cause increased palpitations.
3. Never stop taking medication by yourself. The thyroid levels became normal because of the medicine you took, which reflects later. If you stop, the abnormal results will take a few weeks to show up.
4. Your dose is very small to cause palpitations.  At the most, you can restart with 25 mcg this time and continue for six weeks, then repeat the thyroid function test and revert with reports.
5. Never stop the medicine on your own.
I hope you find it helpful.
Kind regards.","{'score': 91, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hi doctor,I have PCOS, and I have noticed that my sleeping pattern has dramatically changed. I have been eating a lot for the past two weeks. I did some online assessments and found out I have mild depression. Do you think I am having depression or just mood swings? I get irritated easily. Giving treats to myself is not helping me. I feel frustrated. I feel fed up. I have lost interest in exercising and dieting. My depression comes and goes.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I read your question carefully, and the following are my suggestions
Symptoms like low mood, irritability, loss of interest, sleeplessness, low self-esteem, and loss of appetite or excessive eating are all signs of depression. I would suggest you visit a psychiatrist for proper treatment. Medicines of the class SSRI selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors like Escitalopram will help you to recover from the above symptoms in a week. Change your lifestyle. Do morning walks and light exercises. Take healthy food and drink lots of water. PCOD polycystic ovarian disease is a risk factor for depression.
Hope I have answered your query.
If you still have any doubts, you can ask further.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
If you are a young adult male without chronic diseases like hypertension or diabetes, you can enjoy your sex life. However, most males think they cannot perform well with a small penis. I hope that is not the case with you. You will find a lot of supplements online which are useless.
If your erect size is anywhere between 10 to 15 cm, it is adequate for a great sexual life. Make sure you eat healthily and have more green leafy vegetables, boiled eggs, and lean meat like grilled chicken daily. Also, try incorporating walking into your daily life, as 30 to 45 minutes of walking will improve your blood circulation. I suggest you take the following medications
Capsule Absolut multivitamins and minerals daily at bedtime for one month.
Tablet Evion Vitamin E 400 mg daily at bedtime for one month.

"Hi doctor,
I have been in the ER twice in the last two weeks for abdominal pain. The pain is just below my rib cage in the middle of the stomach. It only happens about 2 hours after I eat and lasts for about 6 hours or until the pain medicines they give me. The pain has come like labor pain for hours. They prescribed me Prozantac and Zantac and sent me home. I had to stop eating solid foods for five days. When I eat vegetables or soft food, it mildly made me uncomfortable. I think I may have an ulcer in my intestines. What can I do?","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
We are here to help you.
This kind of pain is mostly due to acid reflux or gall bladder issues like stones in the gall bladder called as cholelithiasis. It can also be due to hiatus hernia associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease GERD.So, for the evaluation of gall bladder issues you should get an ultrasound of the abdomen, which will rule out any cholelithiasis or pancreatitis. If your ultrasound is normal, then you would require treatment for acid reflux.Since you must already be taking treatment for reflux as your problem is chronic, I would advise you to get an upper GI endoscopy done as that would rule out the reflux and the hiatus hernia if any. In acid reflux disease, a combination of Omeprazole and Domperidone helps greatly. You should take  soft and bland diet as spicy food aggravates acidity. In case of acute pain, I suggest antiflatulent syrup like Digene or Gelusil. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent.

"Hello doctor,
I am getting blood in cough. What should I do? Please suggest some medicine.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
The question is what and where the blood is coming from hemoptysis. For people with a prolonged cough, you can sometimes have a small tear in tissues which leads to a very small amount of blood. This is something that would happen after multiple days of severe coughing. This is a scenario in which an investigation into the source of the cough is warranted to treat the underlying problem.
If it is a large amount of blood or regular bleeding with coughs, this sounds like something that needs to be evaluated by a physician as soon as possible. There are not many normal reasons for there to be persistent bleeding. Possibilities include infection TB, lung clots, or bleeding vessels of the esophagus, among others. Signs of active and or large-volume blood loss include lightheadedness, dizziness, and fatigue.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

Today, I woke up and my eye has become doubled in size accompanied by temperatures, headache, chills, and mild sore throat. I went to the doctor and explained my symptoms including that at work my colleague had recently been off with glandular fever. He checked my eyes, gave me drops and sent me on my way. My eye is not better despite doing the drops every two hours as instructed. I still have all the other symptoms and none are calming down.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
According to the history and the photo you attached. attachment removed to protect patient identity. There is mild lid edema, conjunctival chemosis and confession seen. There is also a history of glandular fever to your friend. My top of the differential diagnosis would be pharyngoconjunctival fever. It is caused by an adenoviral commonly type 3 and causes sore throat, fever, conjunctivitis that manifest as watering, photophobia and swelling in some cases there may be rash. It is a self-limited disease. It can take one to three weeks. Only symptomatic treatment is given. For prompt relief apply cold compresses two to three times daily. Topical Vasoconstrictor gives rapid improvement. Artificial tear drops give some relief. Prophylactic antibiotic drops are given to avoid any bacterial infection. Sometimes oral anti-allergic or antihistamine is helpful if there is itching. You will get this with your doctors prescription. So do not worry it will be alright. What you have to do is to protect everyone else. It is a viral disease and a contagious one. So your family, kids and colleagues can get this from you.

From your description, I understand they treated the scar with a laser. Then the laser went just to the skin of the eyelid and did not enter the eye.

You may feel eye pain, redness of the eye, watery eye,  sensation to light,  blurred vision, etc., or anything wrong compared with the normal eye.

CBT cognitive behavioral therapy does not mean only exposure to fearful situations and then desensitizing. Exposure can be done to group of appliances at a time, rather than a single appliance. Besides this mental exposure task can also be performed which will help to reduce the fear to the electricity. Besides desensitization, EMDR eye movement desensitization and reprocessing can also be used which is equally successful for the treatment of phobias.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Heredomacular degeneration refers to a broad collection of diseases which affect vision by causing problems in the macular region of the retina. Some of these diseases are known to have a hereditary predisposition. The pattern of the precise inheritance can be known if you can provide details of the eye examination and the exact diagnosis made. Coming to the question of your daughters, I am afraid they too are at risk. The best way to deal with the situation is to have regular visits to your ophthalmologist, preferably a retina specialist with a decent setup of retinal diagnostic equipment. Home monitoring The best time to do this would be while they are watching TV or doing some work requiring visual attention, attention is required if they may object to closing one eye go very close to the TV hold books or mobiles very close to their eyes.  Children need at least one ophthalmologist visit a year to screen for and pick up problems at the earliest.

Try to do exercise for 30 minutes for at least five days a week. It can be any activity like walking, jogging, swimming to dancing. If you do these exercise for one to two months, and if there is no loss of weight, then it is necessary to see the thyroid hormone levels.

I should rule out alcohol use or the use of any other drugs. If nothing, then you should get further diagnostic tests to determine the correct diagnosis. Unfortunately, we should think over all possible alternatives until we reach the final diagnosis. Then, try to find a way to persuade him and make him understand his current health situation and the best methods to find the definitive treatment.
Indeed he requires further tests and and has to start the treatment to reduce high ALT alanine transaminase along with healthy changes in diet and lifestyle habits.
Hope this helps.
Thanks and take care.","{'score': 93, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 93, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 88, 'clinical_accuracy': 17, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,
Every morning I wake up and the beard area of my face is full of small red bumps. This has happened for many months now. I wash my face with Cetaphil cleanser and sometimes Ketoconazole shampoo. This removes some of the pus but my face is still red and a little itchy. I took several different antibiotics for severe acne in my teenage years and early 20s. I shave using an electric shaver with a guard so the blade never touches the skin and the hair is still about 2 mm long. What to do?

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I saw your pictures attachment removed to protect patient identity. This condition is called folliculitis. It is the infection of hair follicles that form red bumps and pustules around the opening of hairs on the skin surface. Most of the time the infection is bacterial in origin, caused by Staphylococcus or Streptococcus. Sometimes the yeast in the skin can also be the cause for folliculitis. The treatment for folliculitis includes
Topical Clindamycin antibiotic 1  lotion, apply to the affected area over face in the morning after washing face. Use mild facial cleanser. Cetaphil cleanser is good. You can continue using it.
Topical Miconazole antifungal 2  gel, apply to the affected area over face and neck at night.
Oral tablet Keflex Cephalexin 500 mg. Take one pill two times a day after breakfast and dinner for one week. Take this tablet only if you are not allergic to Penicillin group of medicine.
Before applying the medication, after washing face, clean the area with warm saline water using clean cotton cloth or gauze never cotton, because cotton gets stuck to the skin. Dip the cloth or gauze in warm saline, gently clean the area. Then apply Clindamycin lotion in the morning and Miconazole gel at night. Do not prick the lesions. Wash face very gently. Avoid close shaving or reverse shaving. If this problem is occurring repeatedly then you need to undergo swab testing for culture and sensitivity of the bacteria inside the pus.
Other possibilities are acne and Rosacea. Both can have pustules. Acne involves almost whole of face, chest, and back. Rosacea involves center of the face, chin, nose, and prominence of the cheek. Trying to rule out these two conditions. Can you please answer these questions
Is this limited only to your beard area? in the picture, you have focused only lower face or do you have similar lesions on back, upper face, and chest?
Do you get flushing of the face on exposure to sunlight, on eating spicy food, or on drinking hot beverages?","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 96, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,
I am a 21-year-old with spots and small blackheads on my face. I do not know if I have oily or dry skin. Sometimes I get sudden itching on my face and the pimples start to come out. I had a history of sneezing earlier.
Kindly help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Thank you for your query.
Treatment of acne depends on the grade of acne. Please attach your clinical pictures so that I can decide the grade of acne and suggest medicine accordingly.
Let me give you some information regarding acne.
Acne is a disorder of the pilosebaceous unit, pilo-hair, or sebaceous-oil-producing gland. These pilosebaceous glands are densely distributed over the face, neck, chest, back, shoulder, and arms. It also has a genetic component which means that the appearance and severity of acne depend on the genes from parents.
The sebaceous gland produces oil that is expelled out through the duct which opens on the skins surface.
As long as this duct is intact, oil flows freely out onto the skin. If there is any blockage in the duct, the oil cannot come out, then it starts irritating the surrounding skin and causes blackheads and whiteheads comedones.
Our skin has a commensal harmless bacteria called Propionibacterium acnes P.acnes. This bacteria act on the oil collected inside and causes inflammation leading to red bumps, pustules, cysts, or nodules as it progresses. If acne is not treated on time, it will leave scars.
Hormones have a strong effect on acne. Increased androgen hormone can cause thickening of the wall of the duct, leading to its blockage causing comedones. PCOD polycystic ovarian disease or PCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome is the most frequent hormonal disease causing acne in teenagers as well as adult women.
Environmental, external, or emotional factors can also cause acne. Hot and humid climates cause increased sweat and can clog the pores. The application of oil, oil-based cosmetics, or steroid creams is another cause of acne. Psychological stress is one of the important factors in acne.
I suggest you follow a few general acne skin care tips mentioned below.
Facewash Wash your face with mild cleansers if your face is dry or use benzoyl peroxide face wash if your face is oily. Wash your face three times a day to remove excess oil and dust which accumulates over time on the face.
Sunscreen Use good sunscreen with SPF 50. Apply sunscreen on your whole face 30 minutes before you step out irrespective of the presence of sunlight. UV rays will always be there during day hours. Apply every four hours for maximum benefits. This is because sunscreen can protect your skin from UV rays for four hours. Hence you need to repeat it every four hours. Always use non-comedogenic sunscreen.
Do not pick or squeeze your acne It will leave dark pigmentation and scars, which are even more difficult to treat.
Regular physical exercise It is very essential to keep hormones under check. Exercise for at least 40 minutes a day and six days a week.
No oil massage Avoid oil massage on the scalp as it will aggravate dandruff. If there is oil flow on the facial skin, it can clog the pores leading to comedones.
Vitamin A and water Eat vitamin A-rich fruits and vegetables like papaya, mango, musk melon, pumpkin, carrot, and beetroot. These have beta-carotene in them which is a good antioxidant that is very helpful for healthy skin. Drink two to three liters of water per day as this keeps the skin hydrated.
Cosmetics Always use water-based cosmetics, which have a non-comedogenic label on them.
Stress management Both physical and mental stress cause acne breakouts. Meditation helps control mental stress.
No waxing of hairs on the face Waxing irritates hair follicles and can aggravate pimples. However, threading to remove unwanted facial hair is fine as threading does not affect acne.
Never use steroid creams Steroid causes very bad acne, it makes the skin very thin and sensitive. Avoid over-the-counter steroid creams like Betnovate, Panderm, etc.
I hope this has helped you.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Since you say your neck is swollen, the infection must be spreading. You better get admitted and start on IV antibiotics.

"Hi doctor,I am a 34-year-old male. My stamina is decreasing. I also want to increase my penis size. Please help.Thank you.","Hi,
We welcome you to the icliniq.com family.
I appreciate the confidence that you place in me for your healthcare consultation.
The average length of the penis varies from 2.5 to 4 inches in the flaccid state and 4.5 to 6.5 inches in the erect state with a diameter of 1 inch. Studies recommend that a flaccid penis length of less than 4.06 cm or an erect penis length of less than 7.62 cm should be considered for treatment. A longer size will not make females happy - it will only cause discomfort. The glans penis is the sensitive area for males. The female sensation will be in the outer part of 5.08 cm. Hence, a  bigger penis or small penis does not affect making a female happy. A male gets an erotic sensation in the glans penis. The other parts of the penis will not cause an erotic stimulus. The only best method for increasing the penis size is through surgical methods like liposuction or the removal of excess fatty tissue around the pubic bone, skin graft, injecting fat into the penis, or injection of HA hyaluronic acid into the penis. Inflatable penile prosthetics are helpful if the size is less than 7.62 cm. There are other methods to increase the size but the chances of improvement are very low. They include
1. Jelqing exercises Jelqing is a natural way to increase the size of the penis. It uses a hand-over-hand rolling motion to move blood to the head of your penis and stretch it like milking. It is a safe method but, can cause pain, irritation, or scar tissue formation if you do it too often or aggressively.
2. Stretching method It involves attaching a stretcher or extender device to the penis. A traction device is attached to the penis to exert gentle tension.
3. Penis enlargement pumps Use a penis enlargement pump once in the morning after or before a bath. Vacuum pumps draw blood into the penis, making it swell, and are used for treating erectile dysfunction. The vacuum pump can make a penis look larger temporarily. But using one too often or for prolonged periods can damage elastic tissue in the penis, leading to fewer firm erections.
4. I suggest using Aljins 69 massage oil Ashwagandha, Mayufal, Kalonji, Kaucha, Tagar, Jayfal Tail, Til Tail, Kapur once a day for massage except the glans penis before bath for three months. Consult your doctor and use medicines accordingly.

"Hello doctor,
I am a 63-year-old man experiencing nasal congestion and difficulty in nasal breathing for more than ten years. Initially, medications and nasal sprays like Otrivin provided temporary relief, but my symptoms worsened this year. Three months ago, I visited an ENT specialist who prescribed antibiotics such as Swich CV 325 mg and Swich CV 200 mg for a 20-day course, along with other medications and nasal wash. Unfortunately, I did not experience significant relief and have been having sleepless nights due to difficulty breathing. The doctor has recommended a nasal endoscopy to investigate possible nasal deformities, as no polyps were visible during the examination. Based on the doctors suspicion, I have decided to proceed with the endoscopy. At this moment, I have a couple of inquiries 1. If surgery is necessary, I would like to know the expected duration of hospital stay and the estimated time for complete recovery. 2. Otrivin nasal spray has provided me with magical relief in the past. Can I continue using it once before bedtime? I greatly appreciate your professional suggestions and value your expertise. Thank you sincerely.","Hello
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern. It is recommended that you undergo a nasal endoscopy, which is a straightforward procedure performed in the doctors office. This procedure provides detailed information about the nasal cavity and nasopharynx, allowing for a comprehensive assessment. It enables visualization of various angles inside the nose, helping to rule out sinusitis infections, polyps, and other abnormal growths. Regarding your use of Otrivin Oxymetazoline hydrochloride nasal spray, it is suggested to discontinue its use. Prolonged and continuous use of Otrivin can lead to rebound nasal congestion with each application. In terms of surgery, most nasal surgeries typically require one-day hospital admission. While full recovery time varies, you can normally resume your regular daily activities within four to five days, but it does not necessarily mean you need complete bed rest. Depending on the specific nasal surgery performed, it usually takes four to six weeks to improve breathing and overall recovery. It would be beneficial if you could share your nasal endoscopy report with us to provide you with more accurate guidance. Hope this helps.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
By looking at history, it seems like chronic pancreatitis for me. Pain after eating, tenderness, loss of weight, bloating sensation are highly suggestive. Mesenteric ischemia also presents in a similar way but is usually seen in the elderly with a history of cardiac disease. Inflammatory bowel disease is another possibility which presents more or less like this. I wanted to know your bowel habits to come closer to the diagnosis. If loose stools and constipation are seen alternatively, probably it is inflammatory bowel disease. If it is a small amount of mucus or sticky kind of stool probably it is chronic pancreatitis. In any case, get an ultrasound abdomen done at the earliest which can lead to some diagnosis before you visit your gastroenterologist.

"Hi doctor,
I am a 17-year-old male. I have high hemoglobin of 17.4 gmdl, and high RBCs. I am not using any medication or have any other problems.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Elevated hemoglobin is seen in smokers living at high altitudes, congestive cardiac failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Some erythropoietin is secreted in adenomas of the kidney, and very rarely, it could be a part of primary polycythemia. Rule out the causes of secondary polycythemia. If all causes are excluded, get JAK2, Exon12, and CALR mutations tested. Even in primary polycythemia, also called polycythemia vera, these mutations are frequently negative. In cases of secondary polycythemia, the treatment of elevated hemoglobin is to treat the cause. In primary polycythemia, if JAK2 is negative, the treatment is therapeutic, including phlebotomy or venesection.
The goal is to keep hemoglobin and hematocrit within the range for males, with less than 50 hematocrits, and females, with less than 48. And hemoglobin in males is 16 and then in females up to 15 gdL. It can be combined with Hydroxyurea in which the dose could be calculated according to the weight of the patient. Repeated venesections or phlebotomies can lead to micronutrient deficiency, especially iron. The patient should be given micronutrient replacement therapy. For JAK2 positive Patients, Jakavi tablets Ruxolitinib are given in a dose of five to 15 mg per day. Another option is Pegasys pegylated interferon alfa-2a in low doses 45 ugs per week in both JAK2 positive and negative cases. CALR positive cases show superior results on this mode. It could take years to cure the disease. Meanwhile, along with all therapeutic modalities, thrombophilia prophylaxis is given. This is not a life-threatening disease. The patient can die with this but does not die of it. In addition, vitamin D is low. Take locally available preparations for this.","{'score': 86, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 8}","{'score': 85, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 5, 'transparency': 8}","{'score': 88, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern. From the symptoms, you have mentioned, it looks like yeast or candidal infection which requires examination and treatment with antifungal. Hence, I would recommend visiting your health care provider for the same. To put your mind, easing masturbation does not cause infection, but the wrong technique or vigorous actions can cause cuts and bruises which can get infected with yeast. Yeast infections are usually due to environmental factors and it is not due to specific actions. Yeast infections occur when there is an overgrowth of yeast, which is commonly permitted by a change in the bacterial environment in the vagina. Anything that changes the bacterial environment, like antibiotics, wearing wet underwear, and poor hygiene can make women prone to yeast infections. So masturbation alone will not certainly give you a yeast infection. However, be aware of what you are using during your masturbation. Certain types of lubricants can change the vaginal environment or could introduce bacteria that could alter the overall environment and open up the risk of infection. Hope this was useful.

"Hello doctor,
I have had constant after images in my eyes for the past few months. My eyes often ache and I am slightly short-sighted. However, I do not wear glasses full-time. I also see floaters and my vision is also very grainy.  I feel like I am going crazy as I am constantly seeing them. Please help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I went through your query and understood your concern.
After images and floaters are two different things. After images are seen physiologically by everybody after looking at bright things and light and are perfectly normal. You may have simply started noticing them now. Floaters occur due to changes in vitreous gel inside the eye. I suggest you get a retina evaluation done by a specialist doctor. Floaters fade away with time. So do not worry. Use your glasses for grainy vision.
I hope this has helped you.

"Hello doctor,
I was diagnosed with PCOS, and the obstetrician told me I had cysts in both ovaries and a retroverted uterus. I was diagnosed a few months back and started taking pills. I had unprotected intercourse with my boyfriend a few days after the diagnosis, but I am continuously taking medications. Is it possible that I will get pregnant?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I read your query and can understand your concern.
PCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome is a hormonal imbalance that can cause anovulatory or irregular cycles, abnormal hair growth, and weight gain. Thin, lean patients also can suffer from PCOS.
As you have taken emergency contraceptive pills for every sexual activity if taken within 72 hours of activity, there would be fewer chances of pregnancy . Do not overtreat or overdose any hormone, as these can cause side effects like irregular periods, breast enlargement, mood variations, clot formation, breast cancer, and endometrial hyperplasia.
Your cycles will be irregular in the coming days as you have taken too many emergency pills.
I suggest following the tips mentioned below.
1. Have a healthy, nutritious diet with low salt, sugar, spice, and oil.
2. Walk and exercise daily. Try to have a normal BMI.
3. Have some recreational activity.
4. To regulate cycles, if not experiencing, then it is better to have combined oral contraceptive pills cyclically for three months.
5. Collect all laboratory results and discuss them with your local gynecologist.
I hope this helps.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Thank you for your query.
It is better to avoid a single contraceptive for years and try to change if you feel that you are getting side effects more than benefits.
There are other choices of contraceptives like implants, IUCD intrauterine contraceptive device Mirena, oral contraceptive pills, mini pills, etc.
You might have unscheduled bleeding or spotting as side effects of long-term use of similar contraceptives as well.
Have a cervical smear as well as to check for any cervical pathology complete blood count and thyroid function tests are also needed.
It is better to have a local hysteroscopic examination by a gynecologist to exclude any other causes of irregular bleeding.
Try to replace the copper IUD with other contraceptives that are convenient for you.
Have tablet Norethisterone 10 mg twice daily from day four to day 24 for three months to have regular cycles.
Start iron supplements immediately and have food rich in iron like apples, carrots, etc.
Follow the results of investigations as I advised above and discuss them here or with a local gynecologist.
Have complete treatment of any health issue you have.
Kindly consult a specialist, talk to them, and take medications with their consent.

"Hi doctor,
I am a 24-year-old girl, and I have been a known case of PCOD for the last two years. Usually, I do not have delayed periods, but in the last few months, I do have delayed periods for which I take a progesterone test. I had bleeding, and the same month I had bleeding again. My doctor prescribed me Primolut for 14 days. I just wanna know the reason for the bleeding and how Primolut works. Is it necessary that bleeding will occur after two to four days after Primolut? What are the causes for not bleeding after taking medicines? Kindly answer.","Hello,
Welcome back to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern.
Let me give you a few facts on PCOD. PCOD polycystic ovarian syndrome is a congenital condition I mean, it is genetically programmed, and you get it from your parents. When you suddenly put on weight, this cholesterol is converted into estrogen hormone if I may simulate, have not you seen obese men developing breast and in young obese girls, who develop periods at a younger age they all have high levels of estrogen hormone or female hormone. In your body too when fat, which is a store for tomorrow, is more than normal, this is converted to the hormone which tips the balance between FSH  from the brain and the ovarian hormone.
FSH follicle-stimulating hormone, as the name suggests, stimulates the follicle from the ovary, but once the follicle is big enough to ovulate, the FSH is suppressed by the same estrogen hormone from the ovary negative feedback. But when the same estrogen hormone is coming from fat, the brain is confused, and follicle growth stops early at a smaller follicle size as the same estrogen level is sensed by the brain and will not rupture next scan, you will see all these follicles as PCOD. This is usually associated with obesity, irregular cycles, no periods for a few months, and later heavy periods with clots and fleshy masses spotting on and off, Thyroid abnormality, and prolactin problem indirectly. You develop that extra pad of fat around the mid-segment of the body, especially the waist, thighs, and breasts, with no fat beyond the elbow and knees. Excessive body hair growth, hair fall, a dark shade over the lower half of the face, acne, oily face skin, black skin over the back of the neck, inner thighs, and under the surface of the breast. May have a family history of diabetes, especially father or his family. This will not allow ovulation to occur at a time and so you cannot get pregnant till treated. It also increases your chances of early pregnancy abortions. But this has a solution.
Your weight has to be,
Weight in kilograms kgs Height in centimeters - 100.
Your expected weight is 52-57 kgs.
Once you reduce weight to the normal range, you will not need any medicine to get periods.
To reduce weight, I suggest,
No fasting, junk food,  fast foods, red meat, and reduced snacks between meals.
Have low calories food, high proteins.
Regular exercise especially for the waist and hip area, aerobics, yoga, brisk walking swing your hands well, and trying to reduce two to four kgs per month. Do not hurry on weight reduction, as it will be difficult to maintain.
As soon as you reduce at least five kgs, you will see changes.
Even if you are in the normal weight range, try this schedule. It will help.
Myo-Inositol, chromium, and N-Acetyl cysteine are supposed to improve ovulation, but nothing is going to work unless you reduce weight.  Instead, you can have Metformin one gram at bedtime, and it will reduce your insulin resistance and also help you in reducing weight.    Now about the bleeding episode, the corpus luteum produces progesterone in the second half of the cycle to maintain the endometrium. In PCOD, as the hormonal milieu inside the ovary is disturbed by raised androgens from the stroma of the ovary hyperplasia of the stroma is seen in PCOD, the quality of corpus luteum is not good, so the luteal phase support is bad also a reason for PCOD ladies needing hormonal support during the initial pregnancy period, to avoid early miscarriage. So the endometrium will not be strong enough to stay on till periods, so you will get bleeding on and off, with or without clots, fleshy masses. Primolut-N norethisterone is to supplement this progesterone support.  Usually, bleeding occurs after seven to ten days of Primolut-N.  If you still do not bleed, it only means the initial priming of the endometrium with estrogen has not been done, which is seen in PCOD. Only such an estrogen-primed endometrium will respond to progesterone.  Then you will need any of the birth control pills twice a day for ten days.
I hope you find it helpful.

Drink seven to eight glasses of water daily. Use sunscreen or lotion if available there 20 minutes before going outdoors for 20 days. It is stress-induced Rosacea. Other conditions similar to it might be sunburn or polymorphic light eruptions. It can be associated with stress, hormonal imbalance, drug-induced, or photo-allergy. Maintain a diary to keep a check on what factors you are allergic to and avoid those factors. Avoid spicy foods, excess caffeine, tea, or soda. Eat a healthy and balanced diet. Reduce salt intake in the diet. Avoid oily food kinds of stuff. Maintain a proper skin routine and avoid scratching or rubbing that area.

1. Staying safe in and around the pool
Avoid taking children between the age of 6 months to 4 years near pools as they may go unnoticed into the pool and may drown. If at all you do take children to the pools make sure they have their floats and other safety equipment on at all times even when out of the pool. Make sure children do not drink the water of the pool.
2. Staying safe in and around a beach
All of the above tips plus be careful of children eating sand. Watch out for sea urchins, crabs and insects that may bite the children. Carry enough water with you and advise the children to drink plenty of water so as to prevent dehydration on a hot sunny day at the beach.
3. Warning signs Breathlessness, fainting, drowsiness, convulsion.
4. Dry drowning is when water enters the childs nose and upper respiratory airway but does not enter the lungs due to spasm of the upper respiratory tract.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I can understand your problem and the reason for your anxiety. Well, the symptoms you mention seem to be due to gastroesophageal reflux disease GERD. And this needs to be treated with some medications and not only with chiropractor treatment.
Well, I do not think that it is because of the pressure or force given ten years back. It is possible that you might have developed symptoms, and that is possibly coincidental and by chance. The symptoms of GERD can remain for many years before they are diagnosed or treated accordingly.
I suggest you take capsule Esomeprazole 40 mg once daily half an hour before breakfast. Take this for two weeks now and monitor your symptoms like a number of episodes in a week, each episodes timing duration, and predominant symptoms such as heartburn, stomach pain, chest pain, nausea, and vomiting. Please share with me this monitoring chart at the end of the week.
I will then decide what treatment adjustments can be done and titrate the dose at a minimum, which can control your symptoms without posing unnecessary side effects of the drugs.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"

If you know any studies, then you could point me to that to have a look at creatinine variations in healthy adults that would be helpful. Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
This is a quite interesting query.
Firstly, the thing you should know is that the creatinine is a byproduct of muscle metabolism which has no role to play in blood.
The amount of creatinine removal from urine depends both on the production from muscle as well as the ability of kidneys to remove it.
So, it will decrease if renal  functions are compromised or the person is immobilized or inactive for long period low production by muscle.
It will  increase if there  is excessive muscular activity or damage to muscle or in severe dehydration.
The normal range is very broad and varies in men and women. In men  it is 16 to 24 mgkg  in 24 hour urine collection.
The values which you have mentioned of last  week are acceptable, but a year back these are too low. Please check whether the reports are given in same units.
Many published studies have been shown a wide range of creatinine excretion in urine in normal males.

I suggest you start capsule Fluoxetine Fluoxetine hydrochloride 20 mg daily in the morning after breakfast. Consult your specialist before taking the medication. It is a schedule x drug and it can not be prescribed on telemedicine as per government rules.
I hope that you get your answer.

"Hi doctor,
I am a 36-year-old male smoker. I have mild hay fever but no other medical issues. For the last week, I have been waking up with a one-sided blocked nose and slight throat irritation. The side of the nose blocked changes, I think depending on which side I lay down on. I then blow my nose hard, both sides and the blocked nose seems to disappear until the next morning. Mucus comes out when I blow. A few days ago a little blood streak with in the mucus but not last couple of days. I have been reading on nasal cancers and am really worried. About a week ago when I woke up with a blocked nose, my eyes and eyebrows were hurting. I am sure I had something similar last year. I have heard of MRI for a separate reason around 6 to 7 months ago and they said everything was fine including sinuses. If it were nasal cancer would one nostril be blocked all day rather than just the morning? Also, would it always be the side of cancer mine switched sides in the morning sometimes right nostril sometimes left? Are these symptoms ones where I should be worried about cancer?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Answering your questions 1. If it were cancer then the block would always be there and that too on the same side or both side. Therewill not be any fluctuation or diurnal variation. 2. It will always be the side where the cancer is. 3. Symptoms, where you should be worried about cancer, are weight loss, loss of appetite, growth protruding out from nostril or protruding into the throat from behind the nose, and bleeding from the nose. The duration of these symptoms will be more than just a few weeks. The explanation for your symptoms It appears like an acute rhinopharyngitis only. This is inflammation of the nasal and pharyngeal cavities. In the initial stages or when the immunity is good, it affects the way you have described. Mornings congestion of throat and nose block is common with rhinopharyngitis. You have mucus also. Mucus when dries up forms crusts inside the nose and when these crusts get dislodged they cause abrasions inside the nose and that can cause bleeding while you blow the nose. Hurting of brows and eyes could be due to sinusitis which is a sequela of rhinitis due to the block of sinus ostia which open into the nose. Is there running nose, sneezing, decreased sense of smell or facial pressure? Any ear symptoms or a headache? Suggestion See the quality of mucus, if it is thick yellow and smelly you may need a course of antibiotics. Otherwise nasal decongestants and systemic decongestants would suffice. In either case, avoid smoking till you are completely fine. Take non-spicy warm foods and do not drink till you get better. Avoid citrus fruits also. Drink plenty of warm liquids and water. Can apply few drops of Otrivin nose drops before sleeping in the night. Do not use the nose drops continuously for more than 4 or 5 days. Investigations I do not feel you need to do any investigations now. But to rule out cancer, you may want to do a CT scan of nose and PNS paranasal sinuses-non-contrast one. A complete blood count with serum IgE also would be ideal.","{'score': 95, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 5, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,
I am suffering from ear pain, and a kind of the whole head is blocked like sensation. The left and right ears are blocked with some air or water-like state. I have this ear pain for four days gradually on the same pain note. I have taken Aceclofenac with Paracetamol and Amoxicillin. I have also tried Otorex ear drops, but the pain neither reduced nor increased. The right ear is kind of inflamed and does not even let the drops go through. I am already on Deplatt A, Concor, and Imdur in the morning and Amlong and Rosuvastatin in the night for my angina complaint. I am also on Thyronorm 75 mcg in the morning. I am scared to go out to a hospital due to the pandemic effects, so please advise.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
It looks like you have developed what we call a eustachian tube catarrh. This tube ventilates both the nose and the ear and can get blocked due to allergy or sinusitis or any upper respiratory infection such as common flu. If you have allergic issues, it has to be adequately treated. Tablet Sinarest a combination of Acetaminophen, Chlorpheniramine Maleate, and Phenylephrine Hydrochloride one tablet two times a day, i.e., 12 hours apart for one week can be considered. Otrivin nasal drops three times a day for ten days should also help. Valsalva exercise 15 to 20 times a day. Steam inhalations also do give a little relief. Antibiotics and painkillers will not help as it does not treat the problem. However, complete the course of your antibiotics and do not stop them halfway.

"Hello doctor,
My wife is 34 years old, and we got married two years back. We have lost three pregnancies due to a blighted ovum diagnosis. Kindly advise on how to proceed further.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
We are elated to have you on board at icliniq.com.
I understand that you and your wife have experienced the heartbreak of recurrent pregnancy loss due to a blighted ovum diagnosis. This can be an emotionally and physically challenging journey, and it is important to seek support and guidance as you move forward.
Seeking expert care is a crucial step. I advise you to consult a reproductive endocrinologist RE, who is a specialist in diagnosing and treating infertility and recurrent pregnancy loss. Their expertise can provide valuable insights into the underlying causes of your repeated blighted ovum pregnancies.
Your RE will conduct a thorough evaluation to identify any potential medical conditions or chromosomal abnormalities that may be contributing to these early pregnancy losses. This may include
Medical history This includes a detailed review of your medical history, including any previous pregnancies, surgeries, or medications.
Physical examination A thorough physical examination to assess overall health and rule out any underlying physical conditions is needed.
Hormonal Testing Evaluation of hormone levels to identify any imbalances that could affect pregnancy may be required.
Ultrasound Imaging Visualization of the uterus and ovaries to assess their structure and function.
Genetic testing Given the recurrent nature of your blighted ovum pregnancies, genetic testing is strongly recommended for both you and your wife. This involves analyzing your genetic makeup to identify any abnormalities that could be passed on to your offspring.
Karyotyping This test assesses the overall structure and arrangement of chromosomes, the carriers of genetic information.
Chromosomal Microarray Analysis CMA This more advanced test detects smaller chromosomal abnormalities that may not be visible through traditional karyotyping.
Preimplantation Genetic Testing PGT If genetic testing identifies chromosomal abnormalities, consider discussing Preimplantation Genetic Testing PGT with your RE. PGT involves testing embryos created through in vitro fertilization IVF for genetic abnormalities before implantation. This can help select embryos that are chromosomally normal, reducing the risk of miscarriage.
Immune evaluation Certain immune factors, such as antiphospholipid syndrome or thyroid disorders, can also contribute to recurrent pregnancy loss. Your RE may recommend an immune evaluation to rule out these potential causes.
Emotional well-being Throughout this journey, it is crucial to prioritize your emotional well-being. The emotional toll of recurrent pregnancy loss can be significant, and seeking support is essential. Consider the following
Counseling Individual or couples counseling can provide a safe space to process emotions, develop coping mechanisms, and maintain a healthy relationship amidst challenges.
Support groups Joining support groups for couples facing recurrent pregnancy loss can provide a sense of community, understanding, and shared experiences.
Seeking a second opinion If you have any doubts or concerns about the care you have received, do not hesitate to seek a second opinion from another RE or a fertility specialist at a different hospital. A fresh perspective can ensure you are receiving comprehensive and evidence-based care.
Hope and resilience Remember that even with recurrent pregnancy loss, many couples eventually achieve a successful pregnancy. Stay positive, keep seeking medical guidance, and do not give up hope. Your resilience and determination will be key as you navigate this challenging path towards parenthood.
I wish you good health.
Thank you.","{'score': 92, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 7, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"

"Hi doctor,
I am extremely worried. I was rushed to a hospital two days ago to find out that I was pregnant for ten weeks and four days. I got the Depo shot eight weeks ago and was unaware that I was pregnant. I have been bleeding for two and a half months straight filling up my pad every 15 to 30 minutes, and in the hospital, they said everything was good and that the babys heart was beating well, and I was moving around a lot. I have been in extreme pain today and passing massive blood clots of the size of golf balls during the last five times when I was urinating. I am scared that I am miscarrying, but can that be possible if the ultrasound showed the baby was fine two days ago? I need some reassurance even as to what it might be.
Please help.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Two days back, you had a scan that showed a healthy, alive baby, but after that, you passed big clots along with blood.
1. Better to go to the hospital and get a rescan now to recheck the current situation.
2. When did you have the Depo Medroxyprogesterone acetate injection? The side effect includes unscheduled bleeding, spotting, mood variations, and breast tenderness. Withdrawal bleeds also could be a side effect of this.
3. But the passage of big clots needs rechecking by scan again. It could be a threatened miscarriage, or you might need urgent intervention, as too much bleeding will cause weakness, hypotension, and dizziness. Generally, the body can be affected by heavy blood loss.
You need to do a complete blood count and blood grouping with cross-matching and save serum in case you need a blood transfusion.
I hope you get my point.
If pregnancy remains stable and bleeding subsides with normal scan findings, you need Folic Acid, iron supplements, and some progesterone support to help in pregnancy stability.","{'score': 97, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"

This condition is more of pediatric cardiology rather than adult cardiology. However, I think that if the stenosis is minimal then it should only be observed at this stage with regular yearly echos.

Thank you for your query.
I understand your concern. Several factors, such as sweating, humidity, friction, diabetes, family members with ringworm infection, and contact with pets, promote fungus infection. I suggest you to follow a few instructions mentioned below.
Strictly control the factors that could aggravate the fungal infection, to prevent fungal resistance that may increase the duration of treatment required.
Wash your clothes separately and let them dry properly.
Continue tablet Terbinafine anti-fungal medication for three more weeks.
Do not change medicine without consulting with a specialist, as it could lead to the fungus developing resistance.

"Hello doctor,
I took birth control oral pills a week before having sex. I am still taking those pills for the past two weeks. Now my period is delayed. What to do?
Please help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I can understood your concern.
If you have taken birth control pills continuously for one week before having sex and have been taking them regularly since then, your period may have been delayed due to the hormones in the pills. The hormones in birth control pills can suppress ovulation and prevent the release of an egg from the ovary, which can lead to a delay or absence of periods.
If you have missed your period for more than two weeks, it is recommended to take a pregnancy test to rule out the possibility of pregnancy. If the test is negative, you may want to consult with a healthcare provider to ensure that there are no underlying medical conditions that could be causing the delay in your periods. They can also guide how long you should continue taking the pills before starting a new cycle or switching to a different method of contraception.
Hope it helps.

"Hello doctor,
I am a 37-year-old female and for the past three months, I have been getting periods for 2 days only. Is that normal?
Kindly help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com
It is not uncommon to experience variations in your menstrual cycle length, especially as you age. However, a significant change in your period duration, such as now only lasting 2 days compared to your typical length, warrants a closer look. Here are some possible reasons for your shorter periods
Normal variation As you mentioned, your age could be a factor. Hormonal changes associated with perimenopause, the transition to menopause, can lead to irregular periods, including shorter or lighter bleeding.
Stress Physical or emotional stress can affect your hormone levels and disrupt your menstrual cycle.
Diet and exercise Significant changes in diet or exercise can also impact your hormonal balance and period length.
Underlying health conditions Certain medical conditions, such as thyroid disorders, polycystic ovary syndrome PCOS, or uterine fibroids, can cause abnormal periods.
Birth control Some types of birth control, such as hormonal IUDs or progesterone-only pills, can cause lighter or shorter periods.
It is important to remember that everyones menstrual cycle is unique. What is normal for one person may not be normal for another.

Acne in women can occur due to underlying hormonal imbalance.

So if you have painful pimples, I would like to start you on a short course of antiacne antibiotics to control this initial flare and prevent scarring, and then oral and topical medications to keep acne under control prevent a recurrence. Now Cetaphil is good for skin, and you can continue with that, or I can suggest a different facewash like if your skin is oily.

I understand your concern.
Yes, it is possible that the schizophrenia gene can skip one product in two generations. If your father was suffering from schizophrenia then there is a chance that your child may be suffering from schizophrenia. There is no test through which one can find whether one is a carrier for schizophrenia or not. But if one generation gap is there then the chance of schizophrenia is lower.

Also, I tried penetrating a lot of times, but the moment I come close to it, I lose the erection. We are very frustrated and are yearning to have a baby. Please help us. More importantly, we want to be sexually happy. Please suggest what I can do.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
The normal vagina before sexual intercourse has its walls collapsed on each other. On penetration, the walls open wide apart and take the shape of the husbands penis for more pleasure of both partners.
The cause of losing erection is due to anxiety. You need to calm down and try to put your penis inside or at the opening of the vagina. Even if not fully erect, it will get erect again by friction against the walls of the vagina.
As for having a baby, you can consider ICSI intracytoplasmic sperm injection until the sex problem is solved.

"Hello doctor,
I was diagnosed with a prehypertensive blood pressure of 13080 mmHg last year. So, I am taking Telma 20 mg every morning since. I have reduced the intake of salt and oily food, and I did all the tests like 2D echocardiogram, kidney, urine, and blood tests, and all my reports were normal. I exercise every day for 30 minutes and do yoga. But, whenever I check my BP, it is always 13080 mmHg. Four months back, I got a lipid profile and ECG done, those reports were also normal. But, I have pain on the right side of my chest, when I move my body from right to left. I took Rabeprazole and Dolo for three days, and the pain went away. The pain came back after a couple of days. What to do?","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Thanks for your query.
Pain in the chest could be due to heart pathology, lung pathology, neuromuscular origin or due to gastric acid reflux. Since your ECG electrocardiography is normal, and there is no history of injury, your pain can be due to gastric acid reflux, which can be controlled by taking Pantoprazole 40 mg, before breakfast for seven days. Pantoprazole is better at controlling acid secretion than Rabeprazole. Also, avoid smoking, alcohol, fast foods, etc. But, if the pain still persists, I would suggest you get an ultrasound of the abdomen. Thanks.","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,
I have PCOD. And I am having Metformin and PCOD. But a year ago, I left using it since then, I have been regular on my periods. Recently I got married three months ago, and we have not been using any protection. I am late for my periods by 19 days and two negative pregnancy tests. Due to the pandemic, I am not able to visit any hospital. Please help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Please do not worry, as this can be sorted out. The first thing is that you need to reduce your weight to get your periods regularly without any medications spontaneously. As PCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome is a lifestyle-related problem, it is the weight gain that leads to the hormonal disturbances, causing the symptoms. Also, I would say you should continue retaking your Metformin tablets as they affect regulating your insulin level because the development of insulin resistance is the main culprit for the hormonal disturbances in PCOS. I have the medications to be taken to get your periods, as the pregnancy tests have been negative twice. Please get the blood tests done as advised below once you get your periods on the second or third periods. Meanwhile, try to reduce your weight, do regular exercise, and maintain an excellent strict diet and avoid a sedentary lifestyle. I hope this helps you.","{'score': 92, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,I am an 80-year-old male, with a swollen foot for four days, really painful and hot on palpation, erythematous. No systemic high temperature, normal blood pressure, normal d dimer, and high CRP laboratory tests. Please help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com
I read your query and understand your concern. It is possible that you could be experiencing a condition called cellulitis. Cellulitis is a bacterial infection that affects the skin and underlying tissues, often resulting in redness, warmth, swelling, and pain. The high levels of CRP C-reactive protein in the lab test might indicate an inflammatory response to the infection. While cellulitis can occur in any part of the body, it commonly affects the legs and feet. Since the individuals foot is swollen, painful, hot, and erythematous red, it aligns with the typical symptoms of cellulitis. It is important to emphasize the significance of seeking medical attention promptly for accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. A healthcare professional will assess the individuals symptoms, review their medical history, and order further diagnostic tests, such as blood cultures, to identify the specific bacteria causing the infection. The treatment typically involves antibiotic therapy to eradicate the bacterial infection. Please I encourage the person to consult a physician and start the treatment. I hope I have answered all your queries.

"Hello doctor,
Repeated IVF failure. I would just like an independent opinion, I am 34 years old and already had four failed IVFs. Not once was there a positive pregnancy test. I am healthy, gave birth to a healthy baby boy eight years back with my first husband who sadly passed on a few years ago. Remarried a few years later and have been struggling with infertility. Have been on numerous Clomid and IUI cycles with no success. Finally resorted to IVF and thought that after at least three attempts it would be successful as I had a good response to stimulation and good embryo production. The only issue was my husbands sperm morphology and viscosity. Fertilization was done via ICSI and was told that the blastocyst was top grade and perfect looking and already hatching. Is there any reason why the embryos are failing to implant. I am so frustrated, confused and depressed. The whole experience is emotionally and financially draining especially because I have no issues with my uterus, no hormonal issues, etc. My husband blames me, according to him, if the embryos were perfect looking than the problem surely is me. My clinic said I should come in and try again, however, I do not want to try again not knowing what the problem is or what can be done differently.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I completely empathize with you and understand your concerns here. The primary step where, in your case, things could have gone wrong is the stage of implantation over a non-receptive endometrium of the uterus when a top grade blastocyst is being transferred and each time there is a negative result. The implantation at endometrium is the issue in your case, most likely.
Few things are important for a good endometrium. The endometrial thickness should be more than 9 mm at ET. Good endometrial blood flow in zone 2, 3 and 4 to check for receptivity through transvaginal Doppler study in the mid-cycle before embryo transfer. Before even contemplating IVF, an endometrial biopsy for histopathology report should be obtained to rule out any pre-existent endometritis or and acid-fast bacillus tuberculous cause. The malefactor is taken care of by ICSI and IVF and hence a high-grade blastocyst is being achieved for transfer. I would like you to share with me the last IVF cycle medicinal protocol, scans, follicular monitoring reports and if possible reports of endometrial biopsy for a histopathology, pap smear report, high vaginal swab culture if any for further study and check to ascertain what went wrong in your case.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 91, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}"
"Hello doctor,
I have been taking the birth control pill Cerazette Desogestrel for the past three years. This pill has completely stopped my menstrual cycle, so I no longer get periods. Since yesterday, I have been experiencing some discoloration in my discharge. It is brownish in color and has a sticky consistency. The flow is very light, and I only need to use a panty liner. I am not sure if it is blood it does not seem like a regular period. However, I would like an explanation for the brown discharge, and I want to know if there is any cause for concern. I have also noticed a slight odor in the days leading up to this. The current medical complaint may have previously occurred once or twice. This issue has persisted for the past two days. It is not causing me any discomfort or worry. I am simply curious to understand why this is happening.
Kindly help.","Hello,
I am glad you chose icliniq for your medical-related queries.
I understand your concern. According to your description, this discharge could be due to an infection, and for that, you should take a proper antibiotic course. However, since you mentioned that you are not getting your periods and it has completely stopped, it is a concern. I recommend getting a USG ultrasound pelvis scan, thyroid profile, and CBC complete blood count done to rule out any pathology. For the discharge, take the following medications
Tablet Doxycycline 100 mg twice daily.
Tablet Metronidazole 400 mg thrice daily.
Tablet Pantoprazole 40 mg twice daily before meals.
Clingen a combination of Clindamycin and Clotrimazole vaginal pessary  insert it in the vagina while sleeping at night.
Take these medications for five days. Additionally, keep the area clean and dry, change your undergarments twice a day, and wash your genital area with gentle cleansers to avoid recurring infections. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with them, and take the medicines with their consent.

"Hi doctor,
Being a 39-year-old male, I am really confused now. With all the talk about the ongoing pandemic, I am worried about the impact of climate change on the spread of diseases and the possibility of new pandemics. Can you please explain how climate change is connected to the spread of infectious diseases? What can I do to protect myself and my family from potential new pathogens? What necessary precautions are needed now? How to boost our immunity against developing pathogens?","Hi,
Thank you for trusting us with your healthcare.
I have reviewed your medical history and understand your concerns.
The ongoing spread of a JN.1, a sub-lineage of BA.2.86 Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus is likely due to potential mutations. These mutations will continue occurring with the emergence of newer strains as had been predicted during the end of the pandemic in 2022. As per current WHO statistics, globally, the number of new cases increased by 52 percent during the 28-day period of 20 November to 17 December 2023 as compared to the previous 28-day period, with over 850,000 new cases reported. The number of new deaths decreased by 8 percent as compared to the previous 28-day period, with over 3000 new fatalities reported. As per Indian published statistics of the Union Health Ministry, India has recorded a single-day rise of 774 new cases on Jan 5-6th while the number of active cases stands at 4,187. The currently available data suggests that the JN.1 variant is neither leading to a rapid or massive rise in new cases nor an increase in hospitalization and mortality.
However, it is also believed that climate change and pollution are contributing to the spread of the virus. Climate change and pollution are likely to drastically reduce immunity rather than cause mutations and change the virus. Rather it may cause a general increase in viral illnesses due to this general lowering of immunity. It is important that you follow the basic guidelines to prevent spread such as mask-wearing to prevent both virus spread and pollution, safe distancing, related hand washing, and improvement of immunity by general and specific interventions. Please get vaccinated against multiple strains of influenza. Just hoping that you have taken all COVID-19 vaccine doses during a pandemic.
I hope this has helped you. Please feel free to reach me again, in case of further queries.

"Hello doctor,
More than 20 years ago, I suffered from anxiety derived from the use of drugs and my family situation, from which I recovered with Deanxit and psychoanalytic therapy. Of course, I quitted cocaine forever. I was in therapy for seven years. At the end I recovered completely, having a full and happy life for more than 10 years. I have a great wife and daughter and very good friends and have a good relation with my family. The fact is that I was feeling very well until about two years ago I began to experiment as if I could not enjoy things.
A few months later, being quiet at home at night, an incredible and strong chemical depletion suddenly came over me. It was like a feeling of chemical depletion of the neurotransmitters or something like that in the brain that caused me a downturn similar to when you use drugs. Like when you have a sudden drop of blood pressure. It was not the depression of being crying, feeling of worthlessness, deep sadness. It was these desperate and unbearable feeling. This lasted about 3 days, so I went to my psychiatrist because I could not take that feeling of intense downturn anymore I have to say that years ago I had already felt those feelings for short periods of time, like a few minutes, and then disappeared, but I did not give them much more importance.
He prescribed me Deanxit again two times a day and after four days I was fine. The fact is that he withdrew it a month and the next day I noticed again the unbearable symptoms of the beginning. I went back to the medication and felt good again, but I wanted to switch to a stronger one, following my psychiatrists advice, because sometimes I was still feeling bad. I tried many others that did not work or made me feel worse. I have tried in between other therapies such as cognitive-behavioral, EMDR, acupuncture and I believe that none comes to the heart of the matter, that it is a serious chemical imbalance that is happening to me and that I cannot overcome and balance.
I have also performed neurofeedback, as well as resonance of the head requested by a neurologist and they saw nothing. I am a person who is not obsessed at all with things, very cautious in life and have a successful business for years. I do not usually stress except on some occasions and I consider myself quite rational in general, so I cannot understand why this is happening to me, I am looking for someone who can diagnose my disease, beyond the generic term of depression and anxiety, in which, because of the symptoms that I have explained, I am not reflected. I think that the dysphoria would be the closest, but I also do not feel that irritability that accompanies it.
Have you met a patient with similar symptoms before? Or maybe someone to whom you can refer me to understand what is happening here? I absolutely trust science, and I just want to return to the state of normality that I had before all these crises that, I repeat, are so intense and unbearable that I want to die when I suffer them, and that I need to understand what happens to me, having more opinions from other experts.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
You have actually got everything right with what you think you are experiencing.  It is dysthymia. Basically the neurotransmitter deficiency, be it for whatever reason is the cause. In males, it usually appears between 30 to 40s. Also, it is not necessary to have irritability to be called dysthymic.
Basically, if you look at a figure of 50 between 0 to 100 as normal and the baseline for mood, you are persistently unable to return to the baseline and are always beneath the normal mood, what people call as mildly depressed. This dysthymic period, when an episode of depression is superimposed, is called double depression which is the episodic problems that sometimes occur.
The core of treatment here is the addition of a mood stabilizer, such as Lithium. That in addition to an antidepressant will show you the greatest improvement. Basically the antidepressant will elevate your mood and the mood stabilizer will hold it there. Rest in addition to the medicines, you should continue your therapies as advised.
I hope this helps.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 91, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Usually, the blood test for herpes becomes positive only after 2 to 3 weeks because antibodies in the body take time to give you positive results otherwise false-negative results can occur antibodies test for HSV1 and HSV2. Herpes infections can be diagnosed by looking on the lesions on body and blood investigations are often not required.
If you have any symptoms then consult a nearby physician or dermatologist for further evala uation. Sometimes, the viral culture of a swab from skin lesions or nuclear amplification test NAT can be done without waiting for blood test as this test can be done earlier.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 94, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

The keratosis pilaris cannot be completely cured and it will have a recurrent pattern of coming. Keratosis pilaris is a common, harmless skin condition that causes dry, rough patches and tiny bumps, usually on the upper arms, thighs, cheeks or buttocks. The bumps generally do not hurt or itch. Keratosis pilaris is often considered a variant of normal skin. While there is no cure for keratosis pilaris, these products can help treat those pesky red bumps that show up on the arms and legs. But these red bumps on the skin are very often keratosis pilaris, a harmless albeit annoying skin condition caused by a buildup of keratin in the hair follicle.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
The parasite inside the eye is usually, cysticercus or hydatid. It is not transmitted through natural sexual routes. It is usually ingested through food. Some parasites, for example, lice or mites infesting the eyelashes are transmitted through physical contact. But, they are easily treatable without any long-standing damage. The parasites mentioned above that reside inside the eye are rare and not transmitted through vaginal sex. However, some rare parasites may be transmitted through the skin. Investigations to be done include. Dilated retinal examination, Toxoplasma antibody IgG and IgM and CT scan of the head and orbit for cysticercosis. I advice you to take Antihelminthic, Azithromycin for toxoplasmosis and Steroids to control inflammation. Also, certain infections like toxoplasmosis are bloodborne. So, kindly ascertain with an ophthalmologist about the type and location of the parasite.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I can understand your concern. It is very less likely to get pregnant when the semen has not entered the female genital tract. Also, you mentioned that you used protection during intercourse. So getting pregnant is very less likely to happen. Although you mentioned that you were on the 25th day of your menstrual cycle, the period is considered fertile. You mentioned that the semen was spilled on the outer parts of the vagina. Although that is very less likely to result in pregnancy but to be on the safe side, I suggest you wait for a week or two and if you do not get your periods until then, take a urine pregnancy test.

All STDSexually Transmitted Diseases tests were negative, but I continued to have symptoms. I can say that I have had many over 40 HIV Human Immunodeficiency Virus tests along with syphilis tests. Like I said, no risk exposure for the last seven years. Before four years, I have had HIV third, and fourth generation tests. I also have had proviral HIV 1 and 2. I have had Abbott Real Time RNA as well as western blot, and they have been negative. In the last six years, I have also had many syphilis tests, and everything has been negative.

HIV infection has a window period of one to three months during which the tests can be a false negative. According to WHO World Health Organization, all tests for HIV are considered conclusive at 12 weeks after the last high-risk exposure. For syphilis, the window period is 90 days and beyond which the tests invariably turn positive if infected. In the case of a positive test for syphilis, it is advised to repeat the same at 4 and 12 weeks later. As both your tests are negative beyond the window period, you can be sure that you have not been infected. Kindly upload the latest reports to go through and find out the procedure used and confirm the same.

"Hello doctor,
I have some scars on my legs from when I was a younger kid. So when  I was younger I fell and bruised and got scars. Sometimes, I would scratch my scars and over time the scars become dark and they look ugly. And since then I do not wear shorts or clothes that show my legs. Is there anything I could try to fade the scars or lighten them?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
First of all, your scratching-induced issues over the skin are not scars, rather they are marks that too over a background of another mild skin condition that you seem to have. Scars are aberrations in the skin texture, irrespective of the color change.
What you have is the background of a mild skin condition called macular amyloidosis MA, you may see light brown colored speckled pigmentation in coalescing patches over your leg shins. These arise spontaneously, mostly without any cause, although friction contributes to it in terms of making it worsen and darker. So, do not scratch any further. Few marks, these are the smaller spot-like darker brown colored discrete and are a few in number, a result of the healing of the skin over your pointed scratched areas.
Now MA does not have a permanent treatment and also often does not need it. It may also affect the upper back and upper arms, just have a look. Sometimes, it tends to run in families. Moisturization with Cetaphil dam lotion after bath and before sleeping tends to reduce the associated dryness, itching as well as the roughness of those areas. But many times, especially in girls and women, MA is associated with thyroid dysfunction. So, please get your serum TSH thyroid-stimulating hormone blood test done. For the brown marks that are bothering you, you will require a depigmenting cream to be applied in the night just over the spots and a broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 50 sun protection factor in the daytime on the entire legs daily. I believe Cetaphil UVAUVB sunscreen or Anthelios-XL SPF-60 or Avene sunscreens may be available to you over the counter. Use them daily over the entire legs and the first coat is to be applied at least half an hour before going out.
Now, I would not be able to tell you which depigmenting skin lightening creams are available in your place. But, you can check with your local pharmacist. You could select from a range of combination creams that often contain varying proportions of Hydroquinone, Kojic acid, Glycolic acid, Arbutin, Azelaic acid, mild steroid, Tretinoin, Vitamin C or E, etc. Although it would be ideal that you get a prescription cream from your dermatologist, till then you may for the short time of 15-30 days only use one of these creams, to be used as spot therapy only over the dark spots, in minuscule quantities, that too strictly at night and discontinue using it if it causes excessive redness, peeling, irritation, etc. Additionally, take some good oral anti-oxidant capsules daily for two to three months. For best management, please revert back with the answers to my following queries
Do you have similar pigmentation over the back? Please send pictures in your response. Does your mother or other family members have a similar problem? Get your serum TSH levels checked and let us know the value. Contact the pharmacist and try to procure and use sunscreen and night cream. In your response, please tell us the brand that you procured and the contents of the skin whitening cream so that we could further advise you about its use and safety.
I hope this helps.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 84, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 5, 'transparency': 8}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"

Once more, after eight days without a period, I experienced one, which required a trip to the doctor. She performed an ultrasound and discovered a cyst in my right ovary.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
You have lower abdomen and back pain along with blood in urine along with itching around the pubic area. This happened near your due date for periods. If your observation is really correct, it seems severe urinary infection or some injury anywhere in the urinary tract. First, you should have a urinalysis along with a culture and sensitivity test of urine and also a complete blood count with ESR erythrocyte sedimentation rate that will clear your infection range in blood as well as high vaginal, low vaginal, and urethral swabs for investigations for ruling out itching and irritation locally. It is better to have one ultrasound lower abdomen and pelvis also, including kidneys and ureters as well.

"Hello doctor,
I am a 30-year-old unmarried woman seeking advice regarding a recent lower abdominal pain experienced on the right side. This sharp pain persisted throughout the day, intermittently coming and going. While I have experienced similar pains in the past, this episode was particularly severe. Consequently, I decided to consult a doctor the following day, who then conducted an ultrasound test. The results indicated that my uterus is anteverted and normal in size, outline, and echo texture. My uterus is 8.6 x 4.2 x 4.1 cm in size. The doctor saw two fibroids, the largest one is a subserosal fibroid which is 12.7 x 8.5 cm in size and is situated at the fundus of my uterus. Another one is an intramural fibroid measuring 2.4 x 2.2 cm situated at the posterior wall of my uterus. My endometrial thickness is 1.16 cm. Both ovaries are normal. The right ovary is 2.7 x 2.4 cm in size and the left ovary is 2.6 x 1.6 cm in size. There is no adnexal mass present. Cul de sac is also clear. I am currently taking no medications but I usually have cramps during my periods so I have to take medicine like Feminax and Panadol menstrual to ease the pain. My period lasts for about six to seven days. My mother also had fibroids, for which she underwent a hysterectomy. Please advise if I need surgery immediately as advised by my doctor. I also want to know if it will create fertility issues or complicate the delivery of the child. And is there any possibility of recurrence if I get it removed?","Hello,

I read your query and understood your concern. Based on the information you provided and the images attached attachment removed to protect the patients identity, it seems that you have a sizable fibroid measuring 12.7 x 8.5 cm, which is indeed quite large and may impact your ability to conceive. The recommended course of action is to undergo surgery, specifically for the removal of the fibroid, rather than a complete hysterectomy. Please rest assured that you can still conceive, so there is no need to worry. Once the surgery is completed, it is advisable to plan for pregnancy within the next six months.

I can understand your predicament. A wavering mind can be a sign of anxiety in this context. Have you always been a worrier, or is it something new? Moving houses is known to be a stressful event in ones life. Many people face the same stress in such situations. It is natural to be somewhat anxious about leaving the comfort of a known place and moving to a new house. But with some reasoning and support, you should be able to come to a conclusion and move forward.Did you discuss with your family or friend about the pros and cons of shifting? It can be easier to make a joint decision if you are struggling on your own. Once you decide to shift, go ahead. Accept that you will feel anxious for some time but should settle in due course once you become familiar with the new place. Try relaxation strategies. Practice deep breathing. Exercise regularly. Talk to trusted people. If anxiety about uncertainty is affecting your life significantly, you can also consider therapy and counseling.

"Hi doctor,
I got blood in the stool. I was doing a job in night shift and daily I ate guava and papaya. Please help.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
The stool sample should be sent for microscopic examination, routine and microscopy, to see if it is blood or not. It could be colitis or gastroenteritis. The stool test will make it clear whether there is an infection or it is just due to the disturbed gastrointestinal flora. Our gut consists of its environment of micro organism called gut flora. They are responsible for proper digestion of food. Once the flora is depleted by toxins, then many of gastrointestinal symptoms like loss of appetite, feeling of fullness, bloating, belching, etc., can be there. I would suggest you take a good probiotic for two weeks. It will again replenish the depleted flora. Once the flora is replenished, then the intestinal motility and secretions will be improved. Along with it, I suggest digestive enzymes like Papain and Amylase can be taken twice daily before taking food for a week. Silymarin a potent liver tonic can also be taken for a few days. Also, Isabgol husk two teaspoons twice daily. Eat a lot of fiber in diet 30 to 40 g per day and yogurt. Avoid burger, pizza, and spicy food. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take treatment with consent.

Welcome to icliniq.com. I read your query and understand your concern.
Please check the temperature of the child with a thermometer. The restlessness, headache, and shivering might be due to the start of a fever. If the fever is below 100 degrees Fahrenheit, there is nothing to worry about. I suggest you only provide warmth to the child. If the fever is between 100 degrees Fahrenheit to 102 degrees Fahrenheit, I suggest you give him Crocin DS Paracetamol two teaspoons. If the fever is more than 102 degrees Fahrenheit, I suggest you give Ibugesic plus syrup Ibuprofen and Paracetamol two teaspoons.

"Hi doctor,
I heard that the second dose of AstraZeneca vaccine taken 12 to 16 weeks apart gives an efficacy of 90. In contrast, four to six weeks offers only 79. But one remains exposed to the virus for three months with 40 to 50 higher risk than with 4 to 6 as only one dose gives protection of 30 to 40. Can one take the second dose four to six weeks after and then an effective vaccine that will be available as a booster four to six months later for the new mutant widespread? Kindly advise me if this is medically acceptable given the swarm of cases, no beds, no oxygen, no ventilators, it is hazardous to postpone protection by another three months.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I will go by what is approved.
The gap between the first and second dose is four weeks for most vaccines except Sputnik, where it is 21 days.
Studies have concluded that increasing the gap to six to eight weeks between the first and second dose increases antibody production and thereby gives more efficacy. But it is best to stick to the approval right now.
As for the third dose or third booster, it is theoretical, but data is emerging on its requirements because the efficacy of the first dose stays for up to six months.
Usually, for mutants, another batch of vaccines with the mutant strains or genes of mutant strains in this case, S-protein must be present in inactivated form to provide fuller protection. But current vaccines do not have a mutant strain or modified S-protein genes. Studies have stated that a particular vaccine is protective even in mutant strains for example, South African variant.

"Hello doctor,I am having nightfall every day and I think it is affecting my hair too, increased hair fall. I am so worried about it. What should I do?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com
I read your query and understand your concern. Wet dreams or nightfall called nocturnal emission is normal. It can be due to increased erotic stimulus mentally or physically or visually without sex or masturbation. At this age you will be having good testosterone production, there will be 20000 sperms produced every minute and thats a lot of semen production  you need to let it out by masturbation or sex if not it will come out on its own when you are very much relaxed sleep. Since you know the cause treating is easy. Reduce the frequent erotic stimulus or masturbatehave sex. Ways to reduce the frequent erotic stimulus are
1. Limit the intake of caffeinated beverages and foods after late afternoon. Consuming caffeine before bedtime can stimulate the brain and cause erotic dreams.
2. Take a cold shower before bedtime. This decreases the excessive sensitivity in the genital region.
3. Limit and control your stress levels. Stress can be a triggering factor to anything and everything. Hence to obtain a peaceful nights sleep keeping a check on your stress levels is necessary
4. Avoid sleeping on your back or stomach. These positions are known to cause sleep orgasms. Better sleep on your side.
5. Exercise regularly and keep your body and mind relaxed. Excessive tension or anxiety and body tiredness together elevate your chances of sleep orgasms.
6. Avoid watching and reading erotic content at night. These stimulate both your body and mind and result in wet dreams while you are asleep. For a temporary solution, you can use a tablet. Pari  Paroxetine 10 mg once a night for 15 days. I hope I have cleared all your doubts.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Escitalopram is an effective medication for managing anxiety disorder. The usual dose is between 10 to 20 mg daily. You are currently on 15 mg. Side effects can occur commonly in the first two weeks of starting the medication or increasing the dose, and then it tends to settle. Take your medicine after food to minimize nausea. Depression and lethargy can take up to two to four weeks to get better.
Taking Xanax Alprazolam regularly for more than a month can lead to dependence, and it will cause a withdrawal effect. Consult your doctor and discuss the earliest to gradually taper off Xanax in a safe manner.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern. To understand this, you will need a basic understanding of typhoid antibodies. Typhoid antibodies detection tests are of two types One is quantitative, which detects the amount of IgG and IgM antibodies, and the other one is widal which detects titers. Quantitative tests determine the amount of antibodies in your body which tells the immunity status against typhoid of the body. Whereas, the widal test tells about the current active infection of typhoid. If IgG Immunoglobulin G and IgM Immunoglobulin M are positive, it means your body has good levels of antibodies to fight typhoid. Your widal is negative T.O somatic more than 180 and T.H flagellar more than 1160 is positive. So your widal is negative. So overall conclusion of your reports is that your body has antibodies to fight typhoid and you are currently not infected with typhoid as your widal test is negative. Hope this helps.

Could you please explain if this means I have an allergy to olive trees or ash plants Fraxinus excel or something else?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
We will pay close attention to your worries and address all your questions with utmost care.
Fraxinus excelsior is a common ash plant. It belongs to the olive family. Plants in the same family have shared antigens. If you are sensitive to one plant in the family, then you are likely to be sensitive to others also. Hence, the result means that you are sensitive to olives as well in addition to the Fraxinus excelsior plant.
Being sensitive does not mean you are allergic. Sensitivity does not always result in allergy. Sensitivity means you have circulating antibodies against that particular allergen. However, it may or may not result in an allergy to that particular antigen. Only when you are exposed to it in a particular format and quantity, you will develop an allergy to it. Skin prick test only measures sensitivity to specific allergens.
We need to infer the results based on your symptoms. What do you suffer from? Was the test done to check for aeroallergens or food allergens? The two are different with different symptoms. Kindly elaborate on your problems to us.
Please feel free to reach back to us if you have any further queries.

There are diseases such as nephritic syndrome, membranous glomerulonephritis, etc. It can also be due to some immunological disorders. However, we should rule out kidney ailments first. You should also seek a nephrologist opinion once your CT KUB reports are ready. You should also get your RBS random blood sugar levels checked and get an LFT liver function test done.","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 92, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}"
"Hello doctor,
I have experienced an onset of a rash over the past 48 hours while on holiday in another country. It is super itchy and accompanied by an uncomfortable feeling. The condition is worse on my leg, as pictured, but it is also affecting my scalp, hands, feet, arms, legs, and buttocks. I also had a sore throat in the two days preceding the appearance of the rash. Please help.
Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Thank you for your inquiry.
The presence of rashes, along with a history of fever and sore throat during travel to another country, suggests a possible viral fever, likely stemming from the local viral strain. The current symptoms are indicative of multiple viral infections, including dengue, chikungunya, zika, rickettsial infections, influenza, and measles. Additionally, rare cases might involve acute HIV human immunodeficiency virus infection or bacterial infections such as enteric fever.
To further investigate, I suggest a set of blood tests, including CBC complete blood count, ESR erythrocyte sedimentation rate, CRP c-reactive protein, malarial antigen, mono spot test for infectious mononucleosis, rickettsial IgM, HbsAg hepatitis b surface antigen, hepatitis-E IgM, hepatitis C antibody test, RT-PCR for chikungunya, and influenza panel. A urine examination and throat swab are also essential.
To exclude other potential ailments, blood tests for malaria, viral hepatitis, infectious mononucleosis, and, rarely, locally acquired Ross River virus and Barmah Forest virus are advisable.
For the time being, I suggest you take the following medications
Tablet Levocetirizine-Montelukast One tablet once daily for seven days.
Tablet Paracetamol 650 mg SOS or as an adjunct role for three days, not exceeding prescribed limits.
Kindly undergo the suggested tests, and kindly revert after completion. In the meantime, follow the prescribed medication regimen.
I hope this information helps you.
Thank you.","{'score': 74, 'clinical_accuracy': 15, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 6, 'transparency': 8}","{'score': 81, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 7, 'transparency': 8}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"
"HeIlo doctor,
In the past several months, I was diagnosed with anterior uveitis in my right eye.  Several weeks later, I was also diagnosed in my left eye.  In addition, I experienced some achilles heel tendonitis and back pain.  I completed the 8 week treatment program dilating drops for the first week and slow recession of Steroid drops and about 2 weeks later, symptoms began reappearing in the left eye, followed by the right.  I began another round of Steroid drops in both eyes and slowly tapered the consistency.  I am down to 2 drops per day and I have begun experiencing severe back pain, which had previously quieted down.  Also in the past 2 weeks, I have had a Pityriasis Rosea attack - the 2nd attack in 3-4 years.  I was also treated for bacterial vaginosis a few weeks ago and prescribed antibiotics.  It seems to me that everything is connected, but I tested negative for inflammation in my blood and no doctor has been able to link everything or look at all my symptoms as a whole.  Any help or input is greatly appreciated.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
It seems from the history that you are having recurrent attacks of uveitis. Uveitis is an inflammatory disease of the eye and it can be because of infections, allergies, systemic diseases. Skin diseases like pityriasis can be seen associated with uveitis. However, there is no definitive relationship between vaginosis and uveitis. Back pain because of arthritis is a common association with uveitis. The treatment for uveitis is by steroids and cycloplegic dilating stops as you are taking now and you can continue same treatment. Since the episodes of uveitis are recurrent I advice for a systemic evaluation. The common tests need to be done are complete blood count, ESR, CRP. Since you are having backpain we need to rule out arthritis and spondylitis as a underlying cause. Hence, you require X-ray of spine and RA factor. There is definitive and proven link between back pain and uveitis, hence I advice you to get evaluation done to rule out spondylitis and arthritis.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,
I am a 30-year-old-female. I have a fuzzy head mainly in the mornings, and I have read online and regarding this. It includes stuff like elimination of diet, early menopause, etc. I think it may be due to something like this. I have no pain in my head, but sometimes it makes me anxious and feels sick. I also have asthma.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com. Fuzzy head or brain fog can be due to a lot of causes. Most commonly, patients present to us with a fuzzy head after improper sleep for a long time insomnia, long term stress at the workplace, too much caffeine, or caffeinated drinks. Some medical causes can be low hemoglobin anemia, hypotension, weakness due to improper diet, due to malabsorption, etc. We can not attribute the cause to early menopause. Early menopause is considered only when patients get menopause around 35-40 years of age. You are too young to attribute this cause to early menopause. I will advise you to get the following tests done 1 CBC complete blood count. 2 BP blood pressure monitoring at least three values. 3 LFT liver function test. 4 Stool routine. Once you have the reports ready, you can contact us, and we will help you. Make sure that you are not too anxious because stress will further worsen the symptoms. So try to eat well and stay healthy for the time being. Take a multivitamin supplement like Cobadex vitamin B and C, once daily and also take tablet Evion vitamin E.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"

I have been experiencing weird symptoms lately and want to know what it is. I have been waking up nauseous and, therefore, unable to eat for the past two months. As a result, I felt weak and faint most of the time and had to consult a physician. It was diagnosed that I just had nausea and was prescribed a tablet of Zofran. It would happen for about a week, then disappear before reappearing. However, I feel like it is something way more extensive than that. My nausea comes and goes. I assumed it was acid reflux because I felt no burning sensation or soreness.
Now, I have been experiencing indigestion and my lower back aches. I have noticed that I become hungry shortly after eating. In addition, when I am hungry, I typically do not feel like eating owing to a lack of appetite. I was alright until a few days ago when I woke up feeling ill. I was awakened at 3 A.M. with an extremely terrible surge of nausea. I also forgot to mention that I am terrified of puking.","Hello,

Also, mentioning some general guidelines which he can follow for better control. Regular meal times for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Avoid fried and junk food. You can include the following food in your diet like fresh fruits, veggies, whole grains, beans, peas, low-fat dairy products, fish, nuts like almonds and walnut. You must avoid bakery products, sweets, organ meats, egg yolk, white bread, and white rice, potatoes, red pumpkin, pineapple, sapodilla, mangoes, custard apples, and grapes.

I have been experiencing this since last year and I have not been using any products or straighteners of any sort.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Do not worry. I will help you with your concern. I went through your history and photo attachment removed to protect patient identity, it suggests you have  androgenetic alopecia also known as male pattern baldness. Androgenetic alopecia AGA is a common cause of baldness in men. It is commonly seen in the middle age group men but can start at any age.  AGA occurs due to underlying genetic and hormonal components. As AGA is a progressive condition and without treatment gradual hair thinning will continue. So we need to start you on treatment. Take any good biotin based  hair multivitamins for hair available in your country. I will suggest a few brands to see if you can get it. Take Hair revive or Trichospire these are really good multivitamins for hair. Use Tugain lotion Minoxidil  Finasteride, apply 1 ml of this lotion daily at night in the front and top of the scalp. This treatment will be for a long term. Gradually thinning will stop and hair regrowth will occur but slowly. When you start applying Tugain lotion, you will notice increased hair fall for a few days as Minoxidil sheds damaged hair and make a place for thick healthy hair. So do not stop applying the lotion.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 80, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"

Following is my opinion on your question.
Nipple discharge can be seen when female hormones fluctuate or due to underlying benign breast diseases like fibrocystic disease. I suggest you visit the surgeon for a physical breast examination, and accordingly, an ultrasonography investigation can be done if needed. Sexual arousal and excess stress also sometime could be responsible for nipple discharge. Take regular treatment for PCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome after consulting a gynecologist.

Welcome to icliniq.com. There are no dietary restrictions following a dog bite, and you can eat whatever you like. Also, let me share a few facts about dog bites A 10-day quarantine for the dog that has bitten is generally followed. If the dog develops any personality changes like aggressiveness, excitability, dullness, or any paralysis during this period, the dog should be humanely euthanized.
The most important step is to clean the dog bite wound thoroughly, avoid suturing, and get vaccinated. Avoiding non-vegetarian foods, onions, and garlic following a dog bite is a social taboo and a misconception. There is no scientific explanation to support the relation between the pathogenesis of rabies and the food we eat, to the extent of my knowledge. You can eat everything and just observe the dog.

"Hello doctor,I am a 18-year-old male, 165 centimeters tall and my weight is around 215.5 lbs. I am suffering from a severe cold. It started two days ago and it is only getting worse. When I start working, it arises suddenly and gets worse. I do not have a medical history regarding it and I am not taking any medications for it. I have not taken any laboratory tests for it. Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to Icliniq.com.
I read your query and understand your concern.
Your symptoms suggest you have a common cold. Most colds are viral infections of the upper respiratory tract although bacteria can also infect the upper respiratory tract. Viral colds last about five to ten days before getting better on their own. Most cold symptoms also peak in two to four days.If symptoms continue to get worse and last more than a week you may benefit from a throat swab microscopy, culture and sensitivity, and a course of antibiotics. Consult your physician before taking any laboratory tests and medications. In the meantime try to take lots of water to stay hydrated and keep your throat from getting too dry. You should take over-the-counter lozenges to soothe your throat. You can also take a vitamin C supplement proven to reduce the duration of colds. You can take 200 milligrams of this twice a day. Also, you should take over-the-counter Loratadine Claritin 10 milligrams every day which would help your runny nose. Cough syrup can also be taken although they are of questionable benefit. I do hope you get well soon. Do have a great day ahead, thank you.
I hope I have solved your query.

"Dear doctor  Sorry post so long but have other complex healthy issues I felt you need to know  before answering my query.  I would very much appreciate your patience in reading such a long post but today feeling desperate.
Two years ago I started getting pain in my bladder, groin and urethra.   I have never had any stinging when I pee.  I also started to experience hesitancy before starting to pee and a start stop flow. For nine months I was repeatedly placed on antibiotics by numerous GPS at my practice even though tests coming back negative for an UTI. The antibiotics were doing nothing to help and sometimes after a cause I felt worse as if bladder irritated or inflamed. At the age of ten, I had recurrent kidney infections in both the ureters.
Eventually a GP referred me for a bladder scan.  After the scan I was told it clearly showed I had a retention problem and eventually I saw a urologist.  It was a quick appointment where no tests were done and told it is a common problem and last year had my urethra dilated. I was then told I would be seen again by the urologist in out patients but am still waiting and due to Covid I have no idea how long that may now be.
Prior to the procedure a GP placed me on a drug I cannot recall the name of believing it may be bladder spasms but this intensified the pain,  once it caused me to black out and would vary from day to day, sometimes intense.   Just before the procedure I had an episode of acute urinary retention just after the bladder scan and after being treated in AE was told to stop taking the tablet for suspected muscle spasms of bladder which helped.  The urologist told me if I am not getting stinging when I am wee then it is definitely not an UTI.   Since the procedure nothing has improved but have good days and bad days. But as of  recently am struggling to wee most days despite drinking seven cups of drink a day  including Cranberry juice,  tea,  water and fruit smoothie.   Then a fortnight ago I had gone 22 hours with out a wee so phoned my GP practice.  We are not allocated a specific GP so have a phone consultation same day you phone receptionist then get given an appointment if felt need to see you in person.  I was told he would arrange for a nurse to come and see me the following morning but eventually managed to wee but them its like a flood and sprays all directions, hence nurse cancelled.
However the GP stated an UTI  can cause bladder retention so put on antibiotics for an UTI  with no urine requested for a sample.  I explained pass history and that I had no stinging but told I must take them so I did.  They never helped and I finished the cause four days ago but since then have opposite problem. I am weeing far more but still hard to start and each time its like a dam has burst.  Ever since the antibiotics I have had and still have constant pain in my bladder, groin, lower abdomen and my flank area both sides yet last three days have produced more wee then in last ages not only am I getting the aching and odd stabbing pains like when I have urinary retention but my. bladder feels irritated also as if on fire constantly and at times same sensation down both legs. I have been taking paracetamol maximum dose daily for over two weeks but has not eased pain or discomfort.
Other important information you should know is I have complex neurological problems for which I have been told by the neurology doctor in nothing more can be done. I was diagnosed it before 14 years with the rare movement disorder late onset generalised dystonia. No meds tried helped and before six years, as a last resort had Deep Brain Stimulation surgery with the aim of improving my quality of life but the op failed.  By now I had been medically retired from an office job.  Two weeks after the op I developed myoclonus muscle jerks and a very over exaggerated startle response so placed on o.5mg clonazepram twice daily which helped.
Then I went on to develop seizures and diagnosed eventually with frontal lobe epilepsy with tonic clonic  seizures but discovered I was severely allergic to every epilepsy drug accept one for which I am on maximum dose, before the epilepsy diagnosis my clonazepram was upped to 1mg twice daily to try and stop the heavy falls backwards I was by now having daily.  Since then I have gone onto acquire numerous other neurological symptoms such as stroke symptoms which self resolve within 24 hours, and episodes of tunnel vision and an episode of temporary loss of all sight in one eye. I have also suffered personality changes such as talkativeness, and become very impulsive.  I have also been told I have damage to the thought processing part of my brain causing me memory and recall issues and mild cognitive issues and episodes of confusion.
I have been housebound now seven years and as of six months ago bed bound after four heavy falls in two months from just standing when pulling clothes up after using the toilet and before being able to strap myself safely in my wheelchair. The last fall before three months caused me to be admitted to hospital for a week. After being accessed by a hospital and community physio I have been told I must only transfer to my wheelchair now when a carer here and never go to the bathroom alone.  My muscles are all becoming weaker and weaker despite exercise routines and physio.  My legs, arms, torso, neck, hands and swallowing have become badly affected by my dystonia.
I now have carers four times daily and need help with washing, dressing. meals prepared for me and can now only eat pured food due to worsening dysphagia.  I now wear incontinent pants 247 and the NHS ones leak so buy tenna pull up pants with elasticity  around the legs and maximum protection yet they still leak occasionally. As of yesterday and today despite adding another NHS  pad inside when I wee it goes on so long it soaks through both pads and my clothes and I can feel the wee going all directions even if sitting upright on my adjustable bed.
It goes downwards and leaks and runs down my legs, goes backwards up to bottom half of my back and pours out sideways too despite the elastication for extra protection and soaks my trousers over a large area.  It is stating to ware me down and I feel confused from going from constant retention problems to the opposite and weeing a lot and it spraying all directions and the constant pain  and discomfort.
Now as writing this I feel the need to wee again but now back to stage of  finding it hard to start anything at all.  I just would like some advice please as on top of all my other health issues, muscle spasm pain constantly and constant fatigue and now the bladder problems worse than before urethra dilation but have no idea when I will get to see am urologist again and GPS want to start going back down the antibiotics for UTI route but have no stinging when I wee, but bladder constantly feels as if inflamed inside and burning.
I want and need help but told it could be over a year or more now before I get to see an urologist and feel desperate. I am single and as medically retired 18 years early cannot afford to go to hospital. Is it possible it could maybe interstitial cystitis.   Sorry post so long and thank you for your patience but would appreciate any advice or thoughts you can give me.","Hi and thank you very much for consulting cliniq
Your post is interesting. 58 years female complains of tingling sensation while peeing and pain due bladder spasms. Multiple trials of antibiotics failed. Urethral dilatation was done. Pain is getting worse. Peeing spray in all directions. Difficult to initiate and maintain stream. History of vur repaired before age of 10. History of neurological and myotonic disorder. Generalized muscle weakness.
Dear patient,  You have mixed issue currently ranging between urethral stricture and neurogenic bladder dysfunction. As you ur neurological issue affect ur muscles make them weak. It also making your bladder weak as bladder is a muscle and will be affected by nerves. Bladder neurological issues have been identified as over active bladder and under active bladder. Obstruction caused even after dilatation shows under active bladder or over active bladder with sphincter over activity which we call it as  dyssenergia.
Diagnosis require urodynamic study in order to get proper diagnosis. Treatment in most of times will be according the status of ur bladder. In ur history u mentioned that at ultrasound ur bladder was full. Therefore I can estimate that u got under active bladder. Urethral stricture and under active bladder should be treated by clean intermittent catheterization. Its to place a catheter called low fric catheter in bladder every two to three hours to empty ur urine.
This I think will improve u and will prevent u from developing renal failure due to neurogenic bladder. U can go to pharmacy and by it by name if low fric catheter. To use it u should in front of mirror. Then spread ur legs and with ur left hand spread ur labia then with right hand put the catheter inside urethra. Empty ur bladder then wash the catheter and dry it for next use after two to three hour. Dont wait for desire to pee just do it regularly every three hours. One catheter will last with u for one month. Then u need to change it. Please follow up and update me about your condition and if u need further assistance.

"Hello doctor,I have really bad premature ejaculation that has completely ruined my sex life and libido. Scared to even have sex with my girlfriend now.Kindly help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I can understand your concern about your symptoms. There are many reasons for premature ejaculation. The reasons are
Stressful work  night duties, twenty-four-hour jobs.
Diabetes, hypertension, and thyroid issue have an effect on premature ejaculation. Keeping your blood sugar, blood pressure, and thyroid hormones under control will help you.
On long-term medication related to hypertension and anti-psychiatric medications.
Frequent masturbation or prone masturbation.
Excess porn.
Receiving less foreplay from a partner or lack of knowledge regarding foreplay and female masturbation.
Having an affair gives you a guilty feeling.
Lack of exercise, obesity.
You need to check fasting blood sugar to rule out diabetes, check your blood pressure, and thyroid tests to rule out thyroid issues.
You can use the tablet Duralast 30 mg as a temporary solution.
To Increase the foreplay duration during sex women should receive 15 to 20 minutes of foreplay and men should receive ten to fifteen min of foreplay for a good blood supply to the penis for a long and hard erection. Foreplay should be relaxed manner. Your partner should learn to give foreplay in a way you do not ejaculate and enjoy.
You can try relaxing music.
Delay condoms can help you.
Inserting the penis into the vagina is not everything in sex. Sex is not a race duration does not mean your partner is happy. Love your partner, learn about female masturbation, and give your partner an orgasm or climax.
I hope this has helped you.

"Hello doctor,
I am sorry as this will be a bit long. I will try to explain concisely. I am a 40 year old male, and I weigh 100 kg and 1.85 m tall. I have toxoplasmosis. Last year, I had a weird throat ache, like a persistent itch on the upper side of my left palatine tonsil. It is hard to describe, but it felt like having a stray bit of food stuck there. Over the course of a few weeks, it grew more and more painful, with pain radiating into the left ear and swollen lymph nodes on left side of my neck. So, I went to my doctor. He noticed an irritation there, and said it could be gastric reflux, and prescribed Esomeprazole, which had no effect. We tried some antibiotics, again without result. Other symptoms were mild fever and fatigue.So, after a month, I went to see an ENT specialist. This is when the fun starts. He examined my throat with an endoscope, saw nothing, and said it was gastric reflux. I told him I was a smoker, and he replied that for my peace of mind, we could take some time to figure it out and scheduled an endoscopic lung examination. A procedure which requires general anesthesia, to probe a bit that does not hurt and without doing any kind of non-invasive exam like an x-ray first. I did not do it. However, I did the other exams he wanted like radiography of left sinus and echography of sub-mandibulary gland, both the tests found nothing.The symptoms receded without treatment in the same way they had come, and by two months, everything was gone. And by the end of last year, that itch in my throat came back just like before, and then it became very painful again, with the same scenario. The symptoms were swollen lymph nodes on left side of the neck, mild fever 38C, and fatigue. I also got muscle aches in various places, mostly left arm and left side of the chest muscles. So during the start of this year, I went back to see that specialist. He looked at my throat again, and he found nothing. So, he told me maybe it is psychosomatic, but I should still do an MRI just in case.I went back to my doctor and started from scratch. We did a throat swab, which was normal. The blood test showed toxoplasmosis IgG 2.8 IUmL and toxoplasmosis IgM 3.25 IUmL. Everything else was normal, and I do not have HIV, Lyme, hepatitis A, B, or C, and thyroid hormones are normal. So, I have toxoplasmosis, which according to my doctor, explains all the symptoms except the throat ache, which is very worrying. He says I should still do the MRI. I went to see another ENT who said toxoplasmosis also explains the throat ache, and I should not worry. He told me not to do the MRI. He also told me I had reflux, so I stopped worrying. Does toxoplasmosis and acid reflux explain all the symptoms? Should I do that MRI? Or perhaps do other tests?I smoked from age 25 until last year. I quit for six months, then smoked again for six months, and now just quit again, hopefully for good. Also, I used to drink alcohol in unreasonable quantities at night with friends, but I stopped that too. Since then, I have learned that cigarette and alcohol are a risk of amygdala cancer, but I probably have not got that. Still, it is a good reason to get rid of unhealthy habits. I gained 20 pounds last year after quitting smoking. And lost them with a bit of cycling and a little diet. Right now, I am in a general good shape except a bit of a stomach. When I used to cycle a lot, my rest heart rate was 55 bpm. I had too much work recently to exercise properly, so I am around 70 to 75 bpm right now, and my blood pressure is normal. Thank you for your time.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.Toxoplasmosis has a sore throat as one of its presenting complaints. So, do not worry about the sore throat as well as rest of the symptoms. They are due to toxoplasmosis only as your tests also show positive for antibodies. An MRI need not be done until you have any complaints pertaining to that. Hence, do not go for it now. You can get a FNAC fine needle aspiration cytology done from the swollen lymph nodes in the neck. No other tests are required. Please tell me what medicines have you been taking so far?

"Hello doctor,
I have two instances and I am very worried about them. The first one happened 11 months ago, I met a sex worker at a spa while having intercourse there was some blood on the condom from the vagina, I stopped then and removed the condom. My paranoia thinks when she took the condom after removing something touched the tip of the penis and maybe that was the blood side of the condom. I had no symptoms or problems after that for five months but then recently, I had a cold-like feeling. Then again when somebody around me had a sore throat, I got a sore throat too.
The second one happened around few days ago I just had oral sex receive and intercourse with a sex worker. No condom was used. After that, I started feeling pain in my penis and it was tender to touch and clear water-like fluid came out when I pressed the penis urethra. I felt no other discharge. But I still took one gram of Azithromycin for one day and 500 mg for two days and Doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for seven days. There is tenderness present on my right inner upper thigh and when I started inspecting it deep, I felt a lymph node inside my thigh. My tenderness can be due to muscle stretch or strain but feeling a lymph node underneath was stressful. I am scared of HIV human immunodeficiency virus a lot. Please help.
Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I can understand your concern. I would suggest you get an ultrasound scrotum and penis done.
For relieving pain I would suggest you take a painkiller like tablet Paracetamol or Ibuprofen. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her, and take the medicines with their consent.  Do HIV human immunodeficiency virus, HBsAg Hepatitis B surface antigen, and syphilis test after one week.
Please revert back with the tests.

"Hi doctor,My mother is 71 years old, and she is suffering from pain in the right arm for more than a month now. She has pain in the elbow, shoulder, wrist, and fingers. She is not able to grip even light objects with the fingers. We consulted an orthopedic doctor, who is suspecting tennis elbow. He gave her Emanzen D, Disperzyme, and Pentab DSR. She took these medicines for six days, but there is no improvement. She is also undergoing physiotherapy as advised by the doctor, but there is only a mild reduction in pain during the procedure and the pain increases soon after. There is a slight decrease in pain when she takes rest, but it aggravates when she uses the arm. I have heard about Cortisone injections, which can be giving locally for tennis elbow. Please tell me the pros and cons of taking this injection for her condition.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
It is very unusual for a 71 year old woman to get tennis elbow, so I am not sure that it is the correct diagnosis.
Assuming the diagnosis is correct, then I will recommend waiting and continuing physiotherapy, ultrasound therapy, TENS transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation therapy, ice massage, and gentle stretches of the extensors tendons.
I suggest giving her safer NSAIDs nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like Etodolac or Naproxen or try applying Aceclofenac gel locally. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent.
My concern is with the diagnosis, and I feel it may be coming from the neck as that will involve all the parts that you have mentioned that are sore and that the grip is weak.
I suggest you get an x-ray of the neck and proceed from there, or maybe an MRI of the neck. I will withhold the steroid till the diagnosis is clear.

"Hi doctor,
I have had pain on the tip of my penis for a few months now. I got tested for STDs, there is no STD present. I got tested for a urinary tract infection, there is no bacteria present and no sign of an infection in the urine samples. I also got tested for a mycosis, there does not seem to be a mycosis present. A doctor prescribed oral fluconazole to be taken for three days straight with a local application cream to be applied in the tip of the penis to treat a possible mycosis, but the symptom persists.  I have had trouble ever since my early twenties, the urethra does not completely empty itself and continue dripping a few drops after micturition. I have had issues with skin related problems because of this dripping between the scrotum and the left leg. I managed to solve this problem years ago by keeping the area as dry as possible. I wonder if it could be caused by urine getting stuck near the exit and causing inflammation of the inner walls. I did notice, by looking inside that, urine does get stuck there, not exiting until the beginning of the next micturition.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
The problem appears to be chronic prostatitis. Often, the symptoms are the sensation of incomplete voiding, dysuria, pain in parts of the urethra or perineum, low backache or pain in the calf. I would suggest, tablet Nitrofurantoin SR 100 mg twice daily for one month, an anti-inflammatory like Ibuprofen Isobutylphenyl Propionic acid for about one week if it does not worsen your acidity, and an alpha blocker-like tablet Alfuzosin 10 mg once daily after dinner for one week. Review after one month. There can be remission and relapses. Your doctor may help with the prescriptions. Nitrofurantoin can cause hyperacidity in some patients. If you cannot tolerate Nitrofurantoin, an alternative would be a capsule of Doxycycline 100 mg once daily for one month.

"Hello doctor,
I am an 18-year-old male. I have been having premature ejaculation and nightfall when I am stressed or taking my examinations. This has been happening every day now.
Kindly help.","Hello,Welcome to icliniq.com.Thank you for your query.I can understand your concern.It can be due to increased erotic stimulus, be it mental, physical, or visual, without sex or masturbation. At this age, you will have good testosterone production there will be 20000 sperm produced every minute, and that is a lot of semen production. You need to bring it out by masturbation or sex if not, it will come out on its own when you are very relaxed. Since you know the cause, treating it is easy. Ways to reduce the frequent erotic stimuli areLimit the intake of caffeinated beverages and foods after late afternoon. Consuming caffeine before bedtime can stimulate the brain and cause erotic dreams.Take a cold shower before bedtime. This decreases the excessive sensitivity in the genital region.Limit and control your stress levels. Stress can be a triggering factor to anything and everything. Hence, to obtain a peaceful nights sleep, keeping a check on your stress levels is necessary.Avoid sleeping on your back or stomach. These positions are known to cause sleep orgasms. Better sleep on your side.Exercise regularly and keep your body and mind relaxed. Excessive tension or anxiety and body tiredness together elevate your chances of sleep orgasms.Avoid watching and reading erotic content at night. These stimulate both your body and mind and result in wet dreams while you are asleep.For a temporary solution, you can take tablet Pari 10 mg Paroxetine once a night for 15 days.I hope this has helped you.

"Hi doctor,I recently have a new situation on my right leg, just under the knee cap area. I am 35-year-old, and for my whole life, I thought I had a mole there. Still not sure if it is an actual mole or not. It is mostly flat, with a normal dark color similar to a mole and in size similar to an average mole as well. At times it is a little dry and a bit scaly, as if you could kind of peel off a little bit of the edges although not possible, as it will cause normal damage you would expect. Other than this, it had zero issues my whole life. I do not even have any old pictures of it, as it never caught my special attention. Until the past one and a half months or so, the area started to have a little itch. Nothing too crazy, but the itch is something new, and maybe happens one to two times, during every one to two days, for just a brief moment. I give it a quick casual scratch surrounding the mole area without actually scratching directly on the mole to prevent damage. After about a week since the itch started, I finally decided to take a look, and it seems like that mole is gone or came off. Now there is a flat dark mark remaining, and a new scab or crust starting to form around it, and it is getting bigger as time pass. I have never experienced this before. There is no pain or anything other than the same occasional itch that only just recently began. I do not recall anything specific that happened, other than around the same time I started using a new sunscreen. I do not use sunscreen much at all in the past, but I did purchase a new one around a couple of months ago and had just used it only once on that area so far, not sure if it is related or not. I started taking photos of it for one month and began documenting how it is progressing once every few days. I am attaching the pictures for your reference. What is the issue? Kindly give your opinion.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern. I also appreciate the detailed history of progression and very nice photographic documentation attachments removed to protect the patients identity. The condition is known as Meyerson nevus, other names are Meyerson phenomenon or halo dermatitis, or halo eczema. As the name suggests, there develops an eczematous response around a preexisting, mostly benign melanocytic nevus in this condition. The periphery is more prominent than the immediate area surrounding the nevus. It can happen with few other conditions as well, besides the nevus. The exact cause is unknown, but it is supposed to be an immune response. Sunburn or chemotherapy can precipitate in some cases. Dermatitis itself can last for few weeks to few months and might lead to slight hypopigmentation around the nevus. You can apply a mid-potency steroid cream like Mometasone to reduce the erythema and itching. However, when the condition subsides eventually, the nevus remains unchanged.

"Hi doctor,Please look at my acne and let me know if you think it is mild or severe. Please help.Thanks.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern.
I have reviewed your attached images attachments removed to protect the patients identity. It is a severe type of acne. Pimple is somewhat hormonal and due to oily skin. I suggest you to do the following
1. Do not use hair oil or sticky cream on the face.
2. Avoid oily food, chocolate, or milk products.
3. Avoid dust. Use sunscreen.
4. Do not use any steroid creams.
5. Continue treatment for at least one month.
6. Do not touch acne and avoid pressing it.
For treatment, I suggest you apply Clindamycin for prevention and cure, so I tell patients to use it all over the face in the morning. Also, apply Adapalene gel to use it over acne in the night. Take tablet Doxycycline 100 mg once a day. I suggest you consult a specialist, talk with them, and take the medications with their consent.
I hope this information will help.

"Hello doctor,
I had a 4.4 PSA and had an MRI that was negative.  Six months later my PSA is 5.7 and even though the MRI was negative it is suggested that I should have a prostate biopsy. I am a 73-year-old male. I am certainly not that excited to have a biopsy. Any thoughts?","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I can understand your concern about undergoing an invasive investigation without any symptoms. Let me explain you what does PSA suggest. Basically, PSA is secreted by the prostate as well as some other body tissues. It does not reach circulation and hence remains low in blood as long as the barrier between prostatic tissue and blood vessel is kept intact. Rising PSA is a sign that there is some tissue alteration which has resulted in breach of this barrier. Hence, do not be under the impression that rising PSA always  means malignancy. But it is better to confirm the absence of malignancy by biopsy as, at a PSA level as low as 5.7, even in a unlikely event of report being malignancy, the chances of organ confined lesion is very high, which is easy to treat and chances if cure are high. Hence, it is better to undergo biopsy and get your fears allayed. As such, the biopsy is a very small procedure and safe in experienced hands. Wish you a safe biopsy and I hope the results will be benign.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 96, 'clinical_accuracy': 19, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 9, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

Usually, it takes three months to have complete recovery after arthroscopy with good physiotherapy done regularly. Physiotherapy includes quadriceps strengthening, hamstring stretching, and strengthening, full weight-bearing walking with a hinged knee brace, and knee bending for three weeks.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
For sippy cup baby should have developed some gross motor and fine motor milestone. Baby should be able to sit without support so that it reduces the chance of aspirations and better suck swallow co-ordinations. For fine motor milestone, he or she should able to develop radial and pincer grasp to hold the cup by himself. It should be offered after six months of age because outside milk is easier to digest because of gut maturity.

It is only a little bit, sometimes, the paper is deep red, and all I have to do is blot the area, and it will still be deep red. This has been going on for quite some time a couple of months. There are no painful bumps, and I have no digestive issues. I do not exercise regularly, but I eat pretty well, and I am not overweight. I never have blood spots on my boxers.

My current prescription increased as I have gotten older is 300 mg tablets nightly. Recently that prescription has not been enough, and since any more Lamotrigine would exceed my levels, I was prescribed Levetiracetam, a 500 mg tablet, nightly.

"Hi doctor,
I am on the pill Lo Loestrin, but I have not been consistently taking it. My last period was on the 25th of last month and my average cycle is around 28 days. My husband and I had unprotected sex on 5th and 6th. I noticed some dark brown discharge on my underwear. When I wiped, it was mixed dark brown and red strands of blood. It has been more than 24 hours and very light when I wipe. I also have been experiencing soreness and light cramps as I would feel in the beginning of my period. However, the discomfort in my abdomen is located on one side and it comes and goes. I have soreness in my legs, lower back and breasts. I also have been experiencing some aching sensation in my vagina. I have also experienced sudden feelings of nausea, but it has not lasted very long. When I began spotting, I was very surprised. I have never spotted between periods before. I am not sure if this is because I have missed taking my pills or if it is implantation bleeding. I have been driving myself crazy by thinking that I could actually be pregnant. The thought of having a baby makes me so excited. But, I do not want to get my hopes up. Please clarify.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
The spotting that you are experiencing is probably you have not taken the pill regularly and withdrawal due to that. You had unprotected sex on day 11 and spotting on day 16. I do not think it is implantation bleeding. However, if you are keen to know whether you are pregnant or not, then you can get a blood test beta hCG human chorionic gonadotropin and see the value. Wait for your normal cycle and if you do not get periods, then get a TVS transvaginal scan done. If you are keen to get pregnant then you should not take tablet Lo Loestrin birth control pill since it is a contraceptive.

"Hi doctor,I have mild myopia. I have been prescribed glasses before five years. My first power was -0.25 and -0.5 dioptre. Now it is -2.5 and -3.0 dioptre. At first, my power got increased -0.5 in both eyes every six months. For the last one and a half years, it has got increased to -0.5 in both eyes. I am seeing some hope that my power will become stable and I can be able to reduce it. But I am scared as it has reached -3 in one eye and -4 is considered high myopia. Kindly answer my question. I have consulted many doctors and they told me that myopia cannot be reduced. On the other hand, I have seen people online who have a reduction in myopia in a year or two with high dedication. I also met a person who told me that his myopia was reduced. Can I try these exercises? On the other hand, I have also seen some people saying that it cannot be reduced and it increases with time. I do not want my condition to get improved. Do you recommend a method that helps in reducing myopia or to keep myopia stable? Does walking on the grass help me? Do I need to wear less than prescribed glasses? Will my eyes get adjusted to it if I use them continuously by doing exercises and eating healthy foods? Do you suggest any eye drops?","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have gone through the query and I understand your concern. Myopia does not resolve and only pseudomyopia resolves. For younger children, Atropine can be used as a prophylactic treatment and it is not effective for older children or teens. Exercises are followed for hypermetropia and not for myopia. If your retina is normal, then there is nothing to be worried about when the glass number progresses a bit of 1 diopter range. Orthokeratology contact lenses are proven to modify myopia in short term. But in the long term, there is no difference seen in lens users as well as non-lens users in terms of safety and efficacy. You can try to have a laser procedure to the eyes called LASIK laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis or PRK photorefractive keratectomy and it makes your eyes less dependent on your glasses or contacts. For now, you can manage the condition by using glasses or contact lenses and have ophthalmic checkups yearly. Walking on the grass does not help you but spending time on outdoors helps to reduce screen time. You should use full prescription glasses and you should not reduce the prescribed power. If your vision is 66 with glasses, then it is one of the treatment options for amblyopia and not for simple myopia.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

You need antibiotics to cover the most common bacteria causing superficial skin infection Penicillin family and anti-inflammatory to reduce swelling and pain Diclofenac group. Scenario 2 If you had an ulcer on the underside of the toe, and that has lead to an infection of the toe itself, then it is something that needs specialist consultation, for involvement of infection of the toe bone and the extent of the infection has to be assessed. And if in need of powerful antibiotics, oral or IV may have to be considered, apart from the drainage of pus, clearing of dead tissue from infection site and dressing of the wound. If you do not feel pain, then it is ominous, because, the extent of infection can be far greater than you think, and it needs a surgical consultation at your nearby hospital. Finally, if there had been an ulcer, pressure-relieving footwear might have to be considered to prevent the recurrence of ulcers.

"Hello doctor.I am a 59-year-old female physician with osteoporosis. I received my first treatment last year, which was Reclast. I did not receive any anti-pyretic or anti-inflammatory medication prior to the treatment, and I had a reaction that included rigors, myalgias, esophageal spasms, and bilateral uveitis. Interestingly, I have not observed this reaction in my palliative patients when Zometa is used. I have come across evidence suggesting that Zometa can also be used for osteoporosis.Currently, my medication regimen includes vitamin D, escitalopram, Lipitor, and minoxidil.I would like to know if you agree with this assessment. If so, would having medications prior to the infusion reduce the likelihood of a reaction with the lower dose of Zoledronic acid? If not, does it seem reasonable to consider Prolia as the next step? I have never experienced a fracture, and it appears that osteoporosis may run in my family. Please help.Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I read your query and understand your concern.
Fever is the most common adverse effect associated with Zoledronic acid infusion. Flu-like symptoms, such as fever, chills, bone pain, arthralgias, and myalgias, are occasionally reported but typically resolve within 24 to 48 hours and usually do not require treatment. Some other common side effects occurring in 1 to 10 of cases include nonspecific infections, asthenia, mucositis, chest pain, and leg edema. Zoledronic acid can also lead to renal dysfunction, resulting in Grade 3 increases more than 3 times the upper limit of normal in serum creatinine in 2.3 of patients, as well as blood urea increases.Uncommon side effects 0.1 to 1 incidence include acute renal failure, hematuria, proteinuria, and pollakiuria. Very rarely less than 0.01 of cases, uveitis, episcleritis, and iritis have been associated with zoledronic acid injection. Zoledronic acid is typically administered as a 5 mg infusion for one year in osteoporosis treatment and 4 mg for hypercalcemia. Given your previous reactions, it may be advisable to avoid its use in the future.
Alternative options like Denosumab, administered as a 6-monthly injection, can be considered. However, before starting Denosumab, it is essential to conduct tests to rule out any chronic infections like tuberculosis or hepatitis BC. Denosumab treatment should continue for a longer duration as discontinuing it can lead to increased bone demineralization. You can also consider using Alendronic acid in tablet form. In cases where Denosumab is used sequentially, additional therapy with bisphosphonates is required 6-7 months after the last dose of Denosumab. This is important because discontinuation of Denosumab after two or more doses has been linked to rapid bone loss and the development of new vertebral compression fractures within 7-9 months after the last dose.
The primary goal of osteoporosis treatment is fracture prevention, particularly hip, vertebral, and radial fractures. Exercise, adequate calcium intake, and vitamin D with supplementation if necessary are suggested for individuals with osteoporosis. There are two categories of drugs used for osteoporosis management antiresorptive drugs, which inhibit bone resorption, and anabolic drugs, which stimulate bone formation. Antiresorptive drugs include bisphosphonates, estrogen, selective estrogen receptor modulators SERMs, calcitonin, denosumab, and romosozumab. Other options include parathyroid-like drugs.
Hope this information helps you.

"Hello doctor,
I have phimosis as long as I can remember. Around my 20s, my phimosis started getting worse, and my foreskin kept getting tighter to the point where the opening is now about 4 mm, and I have ballooning of the foreskin. I am 40 now and would like to get it treated once and for all. Here are my questions and concerns, is the progressive tightening always a sign of BXO lichen sclerosus. If the opening is only about 4 mm and I went for an initial visit to a urologist, how would they visualize the glans for any suspect lesions? If I wanted to confirm the health of my foreskin and glans especially the presence of BXO or cancer, how can the urologist carry out his tests such as visualizations under the foreskin and taking biopsies without performing a circumcision? While I know that BXO is a risk factor for penile cancer, I would like to get an idea of my risk in terms of numbers if possible. Is it possible that my BXO if present could have turned to penile cancer without me exhibiting symptoms? The only symptoms I usually feel are the foreskin tightening even in the absence of stretching it and occasional frenulum pain. When I roll back my foreskin, the part behind the opening looks lighted I have attached image. Could this be an indication of lichen sclerosus?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have gone through your case, and the following are my pointwise answers. The progressive tightening foreskin is not always suggestive of BXO. Instead, gradual tightening is an age-related process when a male does not retract foreskin often and clean the undersurface. Proper inspection of the suspect lesion is only possible after adequate circumcision. Hence the first step in such cases is circumcision. As I pointed out before, the histopathological examination of circumcised skin is the only evidence to prove or disprove BXO. Any other method is incomplete and inconclusive. Though BXO is a risk factor for penile cancer, the occasional pain and tightening on its own does not amount to cancer. However, his to pathology is the only proof for definitive diagnosis. As you have phimosis, you are unable to pull back foreskin completely. Hence, the undersurface of the foreskin is not visible. However, the discoloration and fissuring are indications of BXO, though it needs to be confirmed histopathologically. I hope I have answered all your queries.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 82, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}"

"Hello doctor,
I keep seeing blobs of different colors, and my vision can be quite speckly at times, with lots of floaters, and I look at some shapes and still see the outlines elsewhere, my right eye flare-up, and bloodshot some days from the nose corner, out and dissipating towards the color of the eye.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Thanks for your query.
Floaters are common in most people, especially if you have a refractive error like myopia or shortsightedness. But you do need to monitor these floaters by getting a dilated retinal check-up every year as sometimes degenerative changes in the retina can cause holes or tears. Depending on the duration of the symptoms you are describing, you see color blobs and have redness of the eyes. Suppose it is of recent onset and associated with pain or a headache occasionally radiating to the heads back. Then the possibility is an inflammation inside the eye called uveitis, or your eye pressure might be high, what we call glaucoma. If the eyes redness is only occasional, totally painless, then it could just be due to dry eyes. The tear film is composed of three layers. When the film is unstable, it can cause diffraction of light by the tear films mucous layer into various colors, which is noticeable in bright light.The after image you describe is also more noticeable when you are in bright sunlight, and when you look into a shadier area and is perfectly normal. I would suggest you share a photo of the eye when it is bloodshot and use lubricating eye drops in the interim. If your eye is painfully red, you will need to meet an Ophthalmologist to rule out the conditions I mentioned. I hope this helps.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,
I have allergy issues for the last 15 to 16 years that started from allergic rhinitis and bronchial asthma. Currently, I am on medications for asthma and sacroiliitis. For the previous two months, I was having some issues and flare-ups. I had blood tests today to check whether I was also infected since my parents were COVID positive post their vaccination. I would be grateful if you can please guide me.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
The most common reason for the symptoms you are having is severe allergic rhinitis with associated sinusitis. Before we go to the treatment, I will try to explain the cascade of events in a simple manner below, even though it is not as simple as it looks. Exposure to dust or any irritative substance that your body is hypersensitive to will initially initiate reflexes such as sneezing to remove the offending agent out. If this fails, mucosal cells in your nose start to hyperfunction producing loads of mucus to trap dust owing to its sticky nature. Mucus is blown out of the nose or pushed into the throat by mucociliary activity, thereby entering a new zone. The throat initially reacts by activating cough impulses to push out the mucus. Still, if that fails, a local inflammation around the throat starts, which often leads to symptoms such as a lump in the throat and repeated feeling to clear the throat. Chronic prolonged inflammation around the nose leads to involvement of the eustachian tubes, which ventilate air and equalize pressure between the nose and the ear. Inflammed lines do not function well, leading to negative pressure in the ear, causing ringing sensations, muffled noise, and sometimes decreased hearing. Long-standing inflammation in the nose also blocks the sinuses outflow tract, leading to secretions getting collected, which then get infected and cause a pressure headache around your eyes, forehead, and cheeks. Your glands also get swollen for the same reason. I know the problem is there for a long time. Still, I am not sure if you have followed any specific treatment chart, which is usually recommended before considering any patient for surgery. This treatment chart is custom-made according to your symptoms and follows the guidelines to treat both allergies and sinusitis. I suggest the following 1. Tablet Sinarest Chlorpheniramine maleate 2 mg, Paracetamol 500 mg, Phenylephrine 10 mg one tablet twice a day after food 12 hours apart for 15 days. 2. Tablet Allegra M Fexofenadine 120 mg and Montelukast 10 mg one tablet twice a day after food 12 hours apart for 15 days. 3. Tablet Zerodol TH 4 mg Aceclofenac 100 mg and Thiocolchicoside 4 mgone tablet twice a day after food for five days. only if there is a headache 3. Tablet Clarithromycin 500 mg one tablet two times a day after food 12 hours apart for seven days. 4. Donate nasal spray Fluticasone propionate 50 mcg and Azelastine 140 mcg two puffs two times a day in both nostrils for three months do not inhale while you spray the drug. 5. Tablet Mucomix 600 mg Acetylcysteine 600 mg one tablet two times a day 12 hours apart after food for one week. 6. Tablet Wysolone 10 mg Prednisolone one tablet after breakfast for one week. 1 Wear an N95 mask at all times, do not allow any dust or irritative substance from entering into your nose. It is the most important thing you should be following failing which, no treatment will bring any relief. 2 Steam inhalations three to four times a day. 3 Saltwater gargles 8 to 10 times a day for one month. 4 Do not smoke or consume alcohol as it slows down mucociliary clearance mechanisms. All precautionary measures have to be followed strictly for maximum relief. Otherwise, medications would not be helpful in the long term. Surgery can be considered if the above medications and preventive measures do not give any relief, but there is a catch. The symptoms might come back sometimes, even on a larger scale, after a brief relief following surgery if the preventive measures post-surgery are not followed. So, ideally speaking in a nutshell, I again emphasize preventing any irritative substance from entering the nose and throat, thereby triggering an allergic cascade of events and reproducing the symptoms you have mentioned above. There is nothing that you need to worry about, once you follow the advice mentioned above, your symptoms should start coming down, and I am sure you will recover with time. I hope I have answered your query in detail. If there is anything more you need to know or enquire, please do let us know, and we will get back to you as soon as possible.

I think you should again start Nextio Fort Escitalopram and Clonazepam for the adequate duration, and if not improved, some second-generation antipsychotic can be added, or try cognitive behavior therapy. For sleep you can take help of sleep hygiene to wake up on fix time irrespective of sleeping hours.

"Hello doctor,
My baby boy is 3.5 months old. He was diagnosed with VSD when he was 2 months and his cardiologist asked for followup after a month. On out checkup his 3 mm VSD was closed, but the doctor discovered 6 mm ostium secundum ASD. He said that it can close spontaneously just like the VSD, so we have to check it after three months. We needed a second opinion so we consulted another cardiologist who echoed my baby and found  out the same results, but he said that it is 6 mm superior secundum, but it will not close on its own cause of its position. Is it really true that my baby can get it closed only by open-heart surgery? I am worried about the scar and the side effects on my baby.","Hello,
Welcome to iclniq.com.
I understand your worries. No need to worry all will be fine. From my experience, ASD atrial septal defect of 6 mm can still close by itself regardless of its position. I will advise you to wait till your baby is 6 months old to have him checked again before a decision can be made to operate on him. It is safer operating on older children than infants. If it does not close, later on, scars would not be a problem. Scars will be minimal and be eliminated using cosmetic or plastic procedures. There is hardly any effects after surgery, he will live a normal life.

I read your query and can understand your concern.
It is least likely that someone with a clear CT scan and bronchoscopy will have lung cancer. So please be assured for now.
The blood may be epistaxis if it originates from the nostril. You should have an ENT evaluation to rule that out. No other investigations are required to rule out lung cancer in the given scenario.
Finally, if symptoms develop when you develop a cold and cough, you can manage it by using remedies for the cold and cough so that it does not recur.

"Hello doctor,I am a 37-year-old male, and I have had blood in my stools for about three days every two weeks for the last eight months. I went to a doctor who did a digital rectal exam and anoscopy. I was diagnosed with hemorrhoids. He prescribed some cream, which I used often. However, the bleeding continued, and then I got anxious. So, I went to the other doctor, who suggested a colonoscopy. I underwent colonoscopy a couple of weeks ago, and everything was clear, except grade 1 hemorrhoids and mild diverticulosis, but the doctor said it is common. No polyps or inflammation was seen. No biopsies were taken. The doctor said my next colonoscopy would be done after 13 years. This week, I saw blood on the toilet paper and a few drops on the stools. I have regular bowel movements with soft stools. I have no pain, except when I go to the toilet. How can grade 1 internal hemorrhoids cause bleeding so frequently? Is there anyone else with internal hemorrhoids and heavy bleeding? Is it something serious? Did colonoscopy fail to detect cancer?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
From the attached reports attachment removed to protect the patients identity, I think it is uncommon to have regular bleeding from that small degree of rectal hemorrhoids, but exceptions are always there. It is uncommon but not impossible. I have seen a few patients bleeding after having small rectal hemorrhoids. However, your symptoms are not suggestive of any other pathology like cancer. I suggest you take the capsule Tranxemic acid antifibrinolytic 500 mg thrice daily to control bleeding. The grade 1 hemorrhoids are too small to be ligated, but I want you to revisit your surgeon to see if he or she can reconsider his or her decision and consider banding ligate to control bleeding.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 91, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 86, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern.
You have rightly said that there is high inflammation in the gut as Zonulin-related proteins get raised in conditions that increase gut permeability. It commonly happens when the gut becomes inflamed. Your levels are very high. The most common cause of raised Zonulin hepatoglobulin precursor levels in stool co-relates with a condition named inflammatory bowel disease IBD. To make a definite diagnosis, I suggest you need further workup like gastroscopy and colonoscopy to get the tissue biopsy for histopathology that confirms the diagnosis. You may also need a CT computerized tomography scan based on your endoscopic examination. Extreme fatigue is part of the disease. I would suggest you meet a gastroenterologist physically who can do all the examinations for you and manage accordingly. Let me know how I can help you further. After diagnosis, treatment will be started, and your zonulin level will come down to normal.

Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I hope you are doing well.
I have reviewed the image you shared attachment removed to protect the patients identity.
After going through the history and the image, it appears to be urticarial hives that have occurred as a response to exposure to a plant or a leaf. Nettle leaf exposure commonly appears as grouped papules or rashes on the exposed area. Rashes may also appear due to insect bite reactions or other allergens like pollutants, paint, polishes, or cloth fibers. However, the rashes shown in the image appear to be in response to a hypersensitivity reaction to a plant family.
I suggest the below advise
Keep a note of any exposure to a plant, insect bites, or any pollutants in general in the past three days following which the rashes have appeared. It will help prevent further exposure and rashes. Also, keep a note of any food allergens or allergic reactions to any particular medication to prevent reactions to them as well.
Mometasone cream can be applied externally on the affected area once daily at night in a minimal quantity. It can be continued for a maximum period of three weeks or till the rash is reduced, whichever comes first. It helps in reducing inflammation, redness, and itching.
Tablet Cetirizine 10 mg to be taken at night for one week. It helps in faster reduction of the current rashes and also prevents itching. It is advised to avoid going out at night or driving, as this tablet can cause a sedative effect. It must be taken an hour before going to bed.
Calamine lotion may also be used multiple times daily on the affected area to reduce itching and inflammation associated with rashes.
Consult a specialist doctor, talk to him or her, and start the medicines with their consent.
I hope the details provided above are informative.

I understand your concern and will surely guide you.
There are chances of bleeding in the first intercourse for the female partner due to tearing of the hymen. Bleeding during the subsequent intercourse may be a sign of infection but in your case it may not be the cause as you had a gap between the intercourse. When there is a gap between the first and the second intercourse there are chances of bleeding which will also depend on other factors like lubrication, the method, etc. Also, about 9 percent of women experience bleeding on subsequent intercourse too.

There is always a post-operative sensitivity after an RCT Root canal treatment.

Birth control pills generally do not affect the lungs. Still, confirm with your pulmonologist to double check. Follicle cysts subside in three months after the oral pills use.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
This depends on the cause. If the cause is ischemic, meaning it has occurred due to blockages and the heart muscle is already dead, then it is unlikely to improve or improve slightly. And if the heart muscle is not dead, then opening the blocked vessel will help in improving heart function. Now, the way to know whether the heart muscle is dead or not is viability assessment with PET positron emission tomography scan. If the cause is non-ischemic with blockages like DCMP dilated cardiomyopathy, then there is a chance for improvement with medication. So basically, there may be some improvement with medicines, but whether marked improvement would occur or not will depend on the viability of heart muscle, which can be known on further testing with PET scan.

The test is of no use as the ELISA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit takes around seven to ten days to test positive, and RNA ribonucleic acid PCR polymerase chain reaction on the 15th day. Fourth generation CMIA chemiluminescence microparticle immunoassay kit test for HIV on the 28th day at the earliest anyone among these if unprotected sex. Throat pain may be seasonal, yet I suggest a hot saline gargle before meals two times a day. I suggest you take the tablet Sigmoflam Aceclofenac, Paracetamol, and Serratiopeptidase three times a day after food for three to five days and the tablet Augmentin Amoxycillin and clavulanic acid 625 mg three times a day after food for three to five days after consulting your physician. Do not worry. HIV status is unknown as the test is not under a window period.
I hope this has answered your query.

"Hello doctor,
I was diagnosed with otosclerosis of left ear at age 42. Thirty years later, I am now 72 and wonder if the condition has likely progressed andor if surgical correction is still possible or advisable. I have good hearing in my right ear. I recently had a wax impaction in the right significantly reducing hearing and it got me thinking perhaps I should have had the surgery.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Otosclerosis often causes mixed hearing loss and can cause a maximum hearing loss of 60 to 70 db hearing loss which can be serviced to a good degree by doing stapedotomy. However, aging often causes presbyacusis that is an age-induced hearing loss which is neural and not salvageable by surgery. Since stapedotomy is a procedure done under local anesthesia, it may be still considered. However, it is possible if there is no significant SNHL sensorineural hearing loss.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 96, 'clinical_accuracy': 19, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern. I have seen the attached file attachment removed to protect the patients identity. Acne vulgaris is a common skin problem in adolescents. In adulthood, it involves pilosebaceous follicles or oil glands. Therefore, it is seen to include areas where oil glands are dense, like the face, chest, back, and upper arms are common sites of involvement. Your case looks like grade 1 or grade 2 acne, which is associated with PCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome. Get USG ultrasonography pelvis to rule out PCOS. You can start using Faceclin gel Clindamycin and Nicotinamide 4  during day time over pimples and Microbenz gel Benzoyl peroxide 3.5   at night over the whole face for around two to three months. For cleaning your face, you can use Face care face wash twice daily. You must have certain dietary restrictions like avoiding spicy oily, junk food, milk products, and non-vegetarian foods.

"Hi doctor,I am a 47-year-old woman, and since last year, I have had excessive periods that did not stop. I visited the doctor, and they said it was menopause but could not make sure. My endometrium sheds little by little with the blood, and pieces come out with blood, but the flow does not stop. It is very irregular, too, the longest one I had was for about a whole one and a half months, and the doctor had to stop it with injections and medications, and now it has started again today. I had a biopsy, so I will attach my reports here. Please look into it.","Hi
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I went through your query and attached reports attachment removed to protect the patients identity and understood your concern.
The ultrasound sound report shows that your endometrial lining, or the inner lining of your uterus, is 20 mm thicker according to your age. However, the biopsy report does not show that you have any cancer. So do not worry. It is quite common at your age to have disorders of the lining of your uterus due to hormonal imbalances.
For treatment of this, I would suggest you consult your local gynecologist for a Mirena IUCD intrauterine contraceptive device insertion inside the uterus. Mirena is a T-shaped plastic frame like copper T inserted into the uterus, releasing a type of hormone progesterone that will correct the thickened endometrial lining. It is not painful and very effective.

"Hello doctor,
I have been struggling with migraine for years, and my neurologist has suggested Rimegepant as a potential treatment. Can you provide detailed information on how it works to alleviate migraine symptoms, the expected onset of relief, and any potential side effects? Additionally, are there lifestyle adjustments or precautions I should be aware of while incorporating Rimegepant into my migraine management plan?
Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I can understand your concern. Rimegepant is a CGRP calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonist. It is a pain reliever specific for migraine, which does not cause vasoconstriction. Its onset is as early as 15 minutes, can last up to two hours, and can be used for acute migraines. Known side effects still pertain to the gastrointestinal tract or you may feel nauseous. Avoid triggers of migraine such as too much salt, MSG monosodium glutamate, dehydration, hunger, and sleep deprivation.
I hope this helps you.

"Hello doctor,
For the past 17 years of my life, I had perfect eyes. I had a slight sinus allergy but nothing else. During high school I took a 500 mg Biotin pill in hopes to stimulate hair growth and the next day my eyes began to tear excessively. The following day my right eye stopped but my left eye continued. It has been almost two and a half years now and my left eye waters excessively to the point people think I am crying. This ordeal is really depressing. Especially, since I have been to four eye specialists and they are not able to help me. One said I had dry eyes, other said I had blocked tear duct, and other said I do not blink. I am currently on Restasis and still no improvement. Please help. This may sound foolish but could it have been the pill? If so is there something I can do or take to reverse it?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
First of all, do not get depressed. Depression leads to a lot of other serious health issues. Now coming to your problem, I do not think your problem is related to Biotin use at least not directly. Biotin is a vitamin, part of vitamin B-complex, which is required for many things i.e. its deficiency in the body leads to a lot of problems. If you have taken antibiotics for a long time then you might have had a biotin deficiency. This deficiency might have resulted in conjunctivitis, which may cause excessive tearing of eyes. And the treatment is regular supplements of vitamin A and B complex. The other cause and this is one of the most common causes is a blocked nasolacrimal duct. See allergies often leads to swelling of tissues around it and thus the ducts get blocked. When the allergies resolve the ducts open by themselves. But sometimes infection or some other cause may keep it blocked. Thus causing excessive tearing. I do not think other causes of excessive tearing are relevant in your case. You should get your eyes checked by an ophthalmologist. Ask himher especially to check for nasolacrimal duct blockage. Alternatively, you can also do a warm massage. Massage your part of the nose, on the side of the eye in which excess tearing is there, from the portion near eye to downwards 1 cm for 10 minutes every few hours, if possible with a warm cloth. This might relieve your blockage to some extent. Take care not to injure yourself. I hope this helps.","{'score': 85, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 7, 'transparency': 8}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"

"Hi doctor,This is the first time I am doing this, and I did this because I badly need someones opinion about what is happening to me. I feel sad, lonely, and alone. I do not know where to start cause I know they are a lot of things that trigger this in me. First, maybe I feel insecure about every little thing. The thing is, I lack the feeling of being loved. I feel like something is always wrong with me, and I am always the bad guy in every circumstance. I feel insecure physically, mentally, and emotionally. Sometimes I enjoy being alone and doing the things that make me happy alone cause that way. No one is going to judge me.For example, in our family, I feel like the black sheep I feel it cause they show it. And that feeling I am feeling right now makes me want to end my life. Every day I keep on saying I want to end myself cause that way, I would not feel the feeling of being anyones friend. The eyes that stab you. I cannot be cured by talking, explaining, or sharing my problems with anyone because I have done that before. I do not know how many times, but I am always being turned down either they say that I am too dramatic, overreacting, and stop adding problems to the family, or worse, being neglected by everyone, even friends and family. So there is no one I could share it with too. So growing up, I kept all those talks and things I wanted to say until I shut down. I shut down to the point that now when they want to dig deeper and know where I am coming from, I do not want to talk about it. I refuse to talk. I do not know myself anymore.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I want to mention that it does not matter what others think about you but yourself. Sometimes you do not have control over the situations and what others do, but how to cope is in your hand.
If you cannot share your feelings with anyone, maintain a stress diary, log down your thoughts uncensored daily, and never read them again. It will help to vent out your emotions. You can also join a self-help group online or offline.
Kindly do a self-rating test of depression like Zungs self-rating depression scale, which you can easily find online, and if it is indicative of moderate to severe depression, consult a psychiatrist in person for detailed evaluation and treatment. Treatment is available in the form of medications and psychotherapy. Do not be so harsh on yourself. It is not your fault. If you are having some psychological issues, you can surely do better.
Remember, every problem has a solution. You need to try solving it, and help is just a step away. Feel free to ask if you have any further queries.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have read the query, and I can understand your concern.
If you have had difficulty passing an embedded toothbrush bristle stuck in your throat for a week, seek medical attention as soon as possible. While it may be possible to dislodge the bristle with the help of solid foods, prolonged retention can lead to complications such as infection, inflammation, and respiratory distress.
In such cases, visit an ear, nose, and throat ENT or otolaryngologist specialist who can perform an examination using specialized equipment such as flexible fiberoptic scopes or X-rays for visualization of foreign bodies in difficult-to-reach areas like airways or esophagus food pipe. They can also provide appropriate treatment options, such as the removal of foreign bodies using specialized instruments or endoscopic techniques if required under local anesthesia or sedation in some cases, depending upon its location in the airway or esophagus.
In the meantime, you can try home remedies to alleviate discomfort, such as gargling with warm salt water, drinking warm liquids, and avoiding irritants such as spicy or acidic foods that may aggravate the discomfort. However, it is essential to prioritize your health and seek medical attention promptly to dodge any potential complications.

I am a 32-year-old, and I did a test for seminal fluid for fertility, and the count was 70 millionml. The doctor only gave me vitamins for three months. Would it improve my chances of having a baby, or do I need something more? Note that my wifes doctor suggested artificial insemination. Please help.
Thanks.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern.
You can have babies, but not by having that vitamin tablet. There is a good count, so the testis usually is producing sperm. Artificial insemination is the treatment if you are not able to have good sex. If you sow a weak seed, the plant will be weak or may die early. Similarly, if the sperm is not healthy, the baby formed is not healthy, so it will not sit in the uterus. Even if it does, it may not be healthy and may abort. There is no significant infection in semen, but RBC red blood cells seen, so there could be an old infection. Your symptoms could be less timing of sex and no control over ejaculation.
You and your partner can have
1. Take a 150 mg tablet of Fluconazole after lunch.
2. Take a tablet of Azithromycin 1 gm stat one hour before food.
3. Take a tablet of Secnidazole forte after dinner.
After finishing these medicines of 20 days, masturbate once, and after three to six days, recheck your semen. You will see the difference in motility. An increase in body weight and fat will keep the testis deeper in the body, so the health of the sperm will not be good. Have a controlled, low-calorie diet and regular exercise.
I hope this information will help you.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have addressed your concern.
Your symptoms could be related to urinary tract infections, including urethritis, and in males, we consider UTIs complicated as the incidence is not as common as in women. So, in addition to the analysis you have sent, we need to follow up on the cultures to rule UTIs out. You should also have an ultrasound to assess any urinary tract abnormality or obstruction that can cause an infection or symptoms like yours. A prostate exam for benign prostatic hyperplasia enlargement should be performed, as a large prostate can cause urinary symptoms and infections. A gonorrhea test PCR can be done with a urethral swab to rule out urethritis secondary to a gonococcal infection, which is considered a sexually transmitted disease if you have the risk factors like multiple or new sexual partners.

"Hello doctor,
I am a 27-year-old male. For the past six months I do not do any physical activities, no exercise, I work only on my laptop and drink very less amount of water. I masturbate almost daily for the past 10 years. I never had sex with any girl. I never used any kind of contaminated stuff with my penis. I never had erection problems in my life in fact, I got erection any time I wanted except when I was extremely stressed. And I always used to have morning erection until I started research on internet. I usually wear tight briefs, and often while wearing tight briefs when I got erection, the tight fitting underwear tries to restrict the erected penis inside. And due to tight fitting brief my penis bend where shaft meets the penis head inside the underwear. And I firmly believe this caused the injury to my penis. When I urinate sometimes some drops of urine are left in my penis head, which comes out later after a minute when I walk back to my room. For the last two months, I have been suffering from very high levels of stress, depression, anxiety, anger related to my job, health, relations, past, and future. And I am severely constipated for the last two months may be due to these stress. I do not have frequent urination.
Last month, I thought I should ask a doctor about this extra skin on my unerected penis see attached photos. I started research on the internet. At this time I do not have any erectile problems and I was not aware of any kind of terrifying disease that can happen to the penis. Everything was alright.  But then, I started reading about the bend I have in my penis see attached photos and I read about all these terrifying diseases Peyronies disease, prostate, etc.. Since then I am extremely terrified, stressed, depressed, hopeless, more constipated, like someone is holding my stomach tightly. And I also breathe very slowly when I think about these things. I cannot take my mind off these problems. I am terrified like I may have one of these untreatable diseases. After this internet research, I cannot think about porn and stuff which I used to think for erection and masturbation. And even if I watch porn or try to think about porn, all these queries and worries are running into the back of my head all the time and I cannot get erection. Yesterday, I masturbated with a fully erected penis. And I am able to get full length erection if somehow I draw my attention off these terrifying things.
I am having very mild pain in my penis on erection. It is like a muscular pain inside the penis and had premature ejaculation this particularly started after internet research. What is the cause of this pain? Are pain and premature ejaculation related? What can be done to solve these problems? I am suffering from erectile dysfunction problem in maintaining an erection. It does not get hard for more than a few seconds. What is the cause? I noticed a darker patch of skin located on my penis shaft. More specifically it is located on the very bottom of the shaft, starting where the shaft meets the scrotum and traveling up towards the head little ways. It is oval in shape. The color is a bit darker than my usual skin tone. What and why is this black skin on the lower side of my penis shaft? What can be done for this extra skin on my unerected penis see attached photos? Is my penis shape normal or not? Why is my penis head bends downward? Is this normal? Why is the head of my penis is large in length? And it often remains less hard spongy on erection while shaft gets very hard? Why not my penis erection is not parallel to the floor which it used to be? It always slopes downward. Is this damaged suspensory penile ligament? Because tight briefs forcefully restricted the erect penis in a downward direction.","Hello,

You should reduce your masturbation habit to two times a week otherwise you will have a lot of problems when you will be married. If you are having early morning erections then you are fine. It is your stress which is causing premature ejaculation. You have to understand that premature ejaculation can be diagnosed when you really do sex with someone. It is normal to have dark areas in penis like you have in the Indian population. You are comparing yourself with people in porn movies. My advice to you is that you must reduce watching porn movies because  it will affect your sexual life when you start doing sex with your partner. People in porn movies take drugs thats why they have a longer duration for doing sex and also you will expect your partner to be like the women you watch in these movies which will also spoil your relationship with your partner.
The extra skin can be reduced by doing circumcision. But it should be done if you are having a problem in rollback on your skin when your penis is in erect form or if you have a problem in doing sex  with someone, in your case since you are a virgin we can say anything for now. And yes, the shape of your penis is normal. You are taking too much tension. The only thing which you really need to do is to reduce doing masturbation. If you do not you will have a lot of problems in the future. Take vitamin E tablets for 15 days once daily.
I hope this helps.","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 93, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,I am 18 years old and have always suffered from awful period pains and I am having extreme heavy flow changing a super tampon every hour, otherwise I leak through. I get cramp so bad that if I do not sort of move around I feel as if I am going to throw up or pass out. I am honestly sick of having to live with this, especially at my age. It is preventing me from doing so much every month and I cannot deal anymore.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand what you are going through. Till the age of 19 to 21, the hormonal balance between the brain and ovaries is not proper. So, the bleeding will be altered, not on a proper date and maybe more than normal. When the blood more than normal has to pass out through the narrow cervical canal, it is very painful, almost like the pain of delivering a baby. Those cramps are due to the blood clot or the fleshy masses at the cervix and your uterus is trying to push it out. Once the mass is out, the pain immediately relieves. Do not worry, we can solve this.
To improve your health, have lots of fruits, vegetables, water, juices, high protein food. Have Iron supplements tablets and multivitamins. This will help you to tide over the loss of blood so far. Get blood tested for Hb  rule out anemia, bleeding time, clotting time, platelet count rule out any bleeding tendency. I hope you do not have any bleeding gums or too much blood from small wounds or nose. If all this is normal, just have cyclically hormone pills or birth control pills or contraceptive pills chemical name Ethinyl estradiol  Levonorgestrel or Desogestrel or Gestodene or Drospirenone like Novelon or Ovral-G, etc. This is not for contraception, it will prevent the hormone imbalance, so the inner lining of the uterus will never be too thick. So, bleeding will never be heavy. So, no pain. Once bleeding is controlled, your pain will disappear and your daily routine will not be disturbed. Do not get stressed out or lose hope, every problem has a solution, you will do absolutely fine.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 84, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 5, 'transparency': 8}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern.
I have reviewed your case history and attached endoscopic images attachments removed to protect the patients identity. There are specific issues that should be addressed.You had significant weight loss, which cannot be ignored, and you should be appropriately evaluated for weight loss, not just focus on your stomach.Oral thrush is not common in a young male with normal immunity again needs detailed history, physical examination, and laboratory investigations, including blood tests.Severe chest pain and shortness of breath during drinking and eating are also not expected. Chest X-ray and repeat endoscopy can be considered.Urine inconvenience again is not explained at your age and needs evaluation.Dizziness and increased bruising can be a sign of vitamin and micronutrient deficiency.My suggestions are as follows
Detailed history and physical examination, baseline investigations including complete blood profile, serum protein, calcium, and tests for malabsorption.It would help if you first visited an internist internal medicine consultation. He will be the person to direct you to the appropriate doctor or any other specialist.For now, you should continue Proton pump inhibitors acid suppression medicine and consider repeat endoscopy as it was significant gastritis on the previous one.
Should improve your diet, a home-cooked balanced diet.
No alcohol or drug abuse, if any.
You can take a high-fiber diet or laxatives like Polyethylene glycol sachet once or twice daily for constipation.

I am sorry to hear about your situation. I can imagine how hard it is to be like this. These sound like self-esteem and confidence issues. You need to talk to a counselor or we can talk online via video consultation, and I can help you with your thoughts. You have self-limiting beliefs, and you need to find out where these thoughts are coming from. Past traumas, childhood memories, and upbringing form our beliefs and who we are. These beliefs can be changed if you work on yourself and your personality, attracting the right type of people who will like you for who you are.

"Hello doctor,
I am waiting for an assessment of autism spectrum disorder. In the past few years, I have been misdiagnosed with bipolar, and my current diagnosis is borderline personality disorder. But, I am not sure what is going on really. I am 100  confident that I am ASD, as it covers my base personality and all my childhood. But, I still do not know if what I am about to describe fits in with ASD. Perhaps, there is co-morbidity that is not just anxiety n depression? I am not sure whether either of the two psychiatric illnesses, that I have previously been diagnosed with, are quite right either. There is bipolar in my family on my moms side, that is, manic depression was the diagnosis for my grandma. My uncle and aunt had bipolar disorder. This as well as autism and ADHD diagnosis across the family. So, that is why the doctors initially looked at bipolar, but they changed their minds because I did not fit the hypomania and good mood state. I think I need to start writing things down, so the doctors can get the full picture because I struggle to explain verbally and lots go unmentioned. Or they just do not ask the right questions and go on what they have. So anyway this is how I have been for about four weeks now, which is the longest I have been like for years. I will describe what I have been paying attention to, which is different to my usual most stable self. This happens numerous times a year, but usually just lasts a few days or could just be a day or two for so many hours in that day. I am more anxious about having to cope with kids on my own, and I am not getting out with them like I used to. I cannot cope with any difficulty right now, so I am snapping too easily. My mind is racing. I am more productive and creative, and I am looking forward to hosting a party. I rearrange the furniture again once the kids are in bed. My mind is crazy, and I get agitated. I am more talkative, and my whole body starts to shake when I get interrupted. I get angry quickly. I am playing kids games better, which I used to struggle with. I have to reach certain numbers of followers not out of vanity, but because some numbers look right and others do not. I like the number 750, but I do not like the number 723, so I keep trying to get followers just so the number looks right. I am telling people personal stuff about my thoughts and feelings that I would not usually divulge. I have in-depth conversations with my sister-in-law, who I usually cannot tolerate. I have periods of high sex drive and sexual confidence with my partner. My patience is so very thin that I am hitting myself and silently screaming in frustration behind my kids backs, as they walk slowly up the stairs or just picking them up and carrying them up in a huff. I am very irritable and easily becoming angry out of nowhere. I have taken up jogging suddenly. I am not anxious about people seeing. I am enjoying jogging because it lets me run away without me running away. I keep feeling like I want to run away. I keep seeing my kids as just some kids and not feeling the connection that they are mine. It feels as if they are not my kids. I feel like sometimes when the anger hits me, I lose touch with reality. I do not want to hurt my kids, but the other day, I grabbed my kids hand so hard as if I am going to hit her, but I ended up hitting the wall. I am here now because I feel like whatever is going on with me is affecting my kids. I am struggling more lately to keep awareness and control over my rage. I am shouting at them easily or speaking to them in a bitchy tone. The worse thing is that I take weeks to feel guilty of what I did. I am worried to tell this to my doctors, as they will want to take my kids away from me. Is this autism-related or does it seem like there is something else going on? If no, then what is it?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
It does not appear to be related to autism spectrum disorder. It goes more in favor of bipolar disorder with a current episode of mania. A personality disorder can also be there. The differential diagnoses are Bipolar disorder, emotionally unstable personality disorder, adult ADHD attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. What you need is an urgent consult with a psychiatrist for detailed evaluation, so that a diagnosis can be established and treatment can be started accordingly. Medications need to be started. I suggest you get the following tests done complete blood panel, TFT thyroid function test, psychological testing. Yes, I know the previous experience was not good, but it does not mean it will be like that always. It is also for the safety of your family. Without treatment, the frequency and severity of episodes can increase. Remember every problem has a solution, you just need to try solving it and help is just a step away.

My period extended up to 65 days, and not yet ovulated. Five days before, I visited our hometown doctor, who suggested some ovulation tablets. Today I faced mild stomach pain, so the hometown doctor took the USG abdomen and told us nothing to worry about. Herewith I attached that report for your kind reference. Is it normal?
Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Tell me which tablet you have taken for ovulation. Also, I saw your ultrasound attachments removed for patient identity protection. It suggests ovulation. The pain you are experiencing is because of ovulation. Based on ultrasound reports, no need to worry about the same. It suggests a small fibroid also, but it is a benign lesion, so you do not need to worry about it. Since you have missed periods, get one urine pregnancy test done. In case of more pain, you can take one tablet of Paracetamol. You also have one mild hemorrhagic cyst it might resolve with your next period.
The probable cause is ovulation pain. Investigations to be done is a urine pregnancy test. Differential diagnoses are ovulation, pelvic inflammatory disease, and hemorrhagic cyst rupture. A preventive measure is weight loss.
Treatment plan
Share your tablets of ovulation.
Wait for periods. If there are no periods, further plan withdrawal bleeding.
In case of persistent abdominal pain or giddiness, visit your local doctor.
Regarding follow-up SOS after one week. Ultrasound after the next period. Follow up if menses still does not come.

"Hi doctor,
I have been dealing with sinus issues pretty much all fall and winter. Three weeks ago I finally decided to head to the doctor and was prescribed a Z-pak for my sinus infection main symptoms were congestion, ear pressure, and lethargy, tiredness. After the Z-pak I was feeling much, much better. Essentially back to normal physically. Now, around two weeks post-antibiotic treatment, I am dealing with some small lingering symptoms, increased mucus in the morning, ear pressure in the mornings and evenings, and a nose blow or two of light yellow snot this was thicker before antibiotics. My question is whether it is worth going back to the doctor to get another round of antibiotics to finish it off or is this something my body will slowly get rid of in some time? I certainly do not want to take another unnecessary course of antibiotics. However, I do want to get rid of the symptoms. I am currently using Flonase in the morning.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
You do not need to go back to the doctor for antibiotics. If you were to come to me at this point, I will examine you and make sure the disease process has reduced. And if everything goes well, I will prescribe you some mucus lightening agents with anti-allergic and continue the spray. Mucus lightening agents are Ambroxol or N-acetylcysteine. Ambroxol 30 mg can be taken twice daily for 3 to 4 days or you may take 75 mg Ambroxol sustained release once daily for 3 to 4 days and thereafter continue either of these regimens till you have phlegm. Anti-allergic is Deslor Desloratadine 5 mg taken once daily or Levocetirizine 5 or Cetirizine 10. Add Singulair 10 mg once daily with these. These two you may have to take till winters resolve. Continue Flonase spray as prescribed. Can try some nasal douching once or twice daily to help alleviate the symptoms. Saline douching can be done.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have read your query and understand your concern.
Your concerns may be related to stress or anxiety, so it is important to relax and exercise regularly. Taking any medication or nutritional supplements regularly might have side effects that contribute to the issue. If the head of your penis comes out during an erection, there is typically no problem. Penis size can only be increased if there is low testosterone. On average, the size of a penis varies from 3.5 inches to 5.5 inches when erect. If your penis falls within this range, there is no need to worry. However, if your penis is smaller, you can consider doing hormone tests. It is worth noting that pornographic films often depict larger penises through the use of harmful methods like drug injections, leading to misconceptions about penis size. In overweight individuals, an inch or more of the penis may be hidden under belly fat, so exercise can be helpful.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 85, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 5, 'transparency': 8}"

They decided to check their heartbeat for the timespan of when they had passed out, and it had gone up to 224 beats per minute. Is it something to be worried about?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Tachycardia is increased heartbeats beyond normal 72 to 90 beats per minute. 224 beats per minute is way beyond the normal limit and probably denotes a heart condition that might be related to rhythm disturbances arrhythmias in the heart. For this purpose, you must get a complete cardiac check-up at a nearby cardiac center. Such abnormalities at extremes of age are even more worrisome. Such elevated heartbeats can also occur in isolated conditions such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and certain other cardiovascular complications.
Please perform the following investigations at a laboratory
1. ECG electrocardiogram- Static and Holter.
2. TMT treadmill test.
3. 2D or 3D Echocardiography.

a CPK-MB Creatinine Phosphokinase-MB enzyme levels.

Obviously, as the gestation increases the cervical length would shorten up more. The cut off is 25 mm, so no point in waiting. Also, add weekly intramuscular Hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection 500 mg would quiesten the uterus without contractions until 32 weeks and it helps. Another thing is strict rest, avoid any strain like constipation, cough, sneeze, strenuous exercises, etc.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 85, 'clinical_accuracy': 19, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}"

"Hello doctor,I had an extra bone removed from each foot when I was a kid, specifically from the arch areas. As a result, I now have a hard lump located northeast of and below my ankle. This lump closely resembles an ankle itself. I experience chronic pain around the lump, extending up through and behind the ankle. The pain worsens with increased walking, to the point where it can be quite challenging to walk, particularly on stairs. Additionally, I have flat feet, but this lump only emerged later in my life and the flat-footedness has not been the primary cause of this heightened level of pain. At times, my ankle also swells. Moreover, there is a substantial bunion on top of the bone connected to my big toe, which not only causes increased discomfort but also seems to be growing. I am unsure if this is related, but there might be some connection to the protrusion at the back of my foot. I have had severe ankle sprains on a few occasions, including a particularly bad one as an adult. While these incidents might not be directly relevant due to the presence of the hard lump resembling an ankle, they are worth noting.When my pain subsides, I have noticed that my arch tends to collapse even more than it did before. Conversely, when the pain intensifies, I tend to shift my weight to the left side of my foot if I am wearing shoes that allow for such adjustment. Sometimes, the pain becomes so severe that walking becomes a real struggle. Currently, I am taking medication for my heart, although I do not have any serious cardiac issues.Thank you.","Hello,Welcome to icliniq.com.It would have been more helpful for me to have access to clinical pictures and X-rays of the foot in order to make a more accurate diagnosis. I understand that you mentioned the accessory navicular bone, which is sometimes removed to alleviate midfoot pain and is also associated with flat feet. The condition you might be referring to is adult-onset acquired flat foot. To properly evaluate this, X-rays and ultrasound of the tibialis posterior, or an MRI magnetic resonance imaging, would be necessary to assess its function. Additionally, a clinical examination would help determine if the heel valgus is correctable. In a worst-case scenario, a fusion of the heel bone might be considered.Thanks and regards.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 82, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hi doctor,
I am an 80-year-old female with some history of slight hypertension but without any other significant health issues. I am not on any medication at all. I usually measure my blood pressure and pulse once or twice a day to monitor it. Historically, my blood pressure has been in a band of 12080 mmHg up to 140100 mmHg or so. Over the last six months, I have occasionally experienced a lower pulse than normal, as low as 40 bpm. In the last week, it has been consistently 40 bpm, and blood pressure has been high at 160 to 200 mmHg systolic. There has been some fluctuation of this, but it is consistently higher than historically. I had a script for Atacand and have been taking up to 32 mg daily over the last week, but my blood pressure has remained high and my pulse low. I do not have any other symptoms. I have had an ECG done at the general physician. I have attached the image attached. Questions Are there other drugs my doctor can consider other than Atacand to reduce my blood pressure? What does the ECG show? What is abnormal repolarisation in this context? Thanks.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Thanks for the query. Your 12 lead ECG electrocardiography shows the right bundle branch block and normal heart rate. The rhythm strip shows intermittent 2nd degree AV block. If you are not taking any rate slowing medicine, then this block can be due to an age-related degenerative process, which may progress to complete heart block. If this is the case, you will have to have a permanent pacemaker implanted. Regarding blood pressure, if it is not controlled with Candesartan 32 mg, then another medicine can be added to it, such as Amlodipine 5 mg initially. If still not controlled, then up titrate to 10 mg. Assess BP over a month or more. If still not controlled, then third medicine can be added. Abnormal repolarization is due to the right bundle branch block and is not significant.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,
I have elevated fasting glucose. My HbA1c was 5.6  last year. I have not been diagnosed as diabetic or pre-diabetic. My fasting blood sugar is between 130 to 150 mgdL after a recent COVID-19 infection and sinus infection. However, before the infection, my levels were 115 to 119 mgdL. I cannot have carbohydrates for dinner else I wake up feeling unwell, and my fasting blood sugars rise to 130 mgdL. I have used the tablet Rexulti for depression, due to which I have gained over 70 lbs of weight. I discontinued it two months back when my weight was as high as 226 lbs.
I was also diagnosed with sleep apnea last year and needed two liters of oxygen. The oxygen therapy was started ten months back. Since then, I have reduced my intake of carbohydrates, and my weight has reduced from 226 lbs to 170 lbs. However, I can eat only 0.3 oz of carbohydrates daily or feel dizzy and sleepy. If I eat more than that, I also feel insulin resistance, and fat gets accumulated over my umbilicus. Is it something related to fluid retention?
I have a lot of fat in my umbilical area and stretch marks on my waist and jawline. I also feel my skin is thinner and my arms and legs look skinny. I am weaker than I have ever been. I cannot lift a 40 lb bag of dog food. Also, I have noticed that I had a moon face five years back.  I am sure I need to get my HbA1C repeated.

"Hello doctor,
I had circumcision done two months ago and I still have swelling around my penis. I did a CBC complete blood count and urine test last week, and all were normal. The doctor last month said that all the incisions have healed. There is no discharge, but I have minor discomfort due to the swelling. Will swelling last this long? How long will it take for the swelling to disappear? Should I be concerned? Will night erections affect healing?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
The healing looks fine attachment removed to protect the patients identity. The swelling is mostly due to an extra skin that is bunching up in a non-erect position. When you have an erection, it might be less prominent. If all excess skin were removed, sometimes there would be pain during erection due to the stretching of the skin. I think things will be fine in about another month. Night erections will not affect healing.

I am sorry for your predicament. It is indeed difficult time due to pandemic. Ideally there should not be any gaps in the treatment, since gap results in increased chances of disease recurrence. I would advise to continue the treatment, however considering the pandemic, the decision to continue radiation is associated with accepting the risk of developing infection, with you having diabetes mellitus and hypertension, you are at a higher risk from getting infected.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have gone through your query. I would like to know a few more details to answer your question better. Have you have had any fever, rashes or joint pains in the last two weeks? Based on your symptoms, it is most likely that you either have a urine infection or some infection of the genitalia. The urine test reports also suggest the same. It would be necessary to have a complete physical examination to find out what is the exact infection and treat it with medication which should be able to get you back to normal.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Sorry to hear your problem. The first thing is that I need to know a few more details about your problem.
Are you getting hemorrhoids or something else? Because bleeding while passing stools are not due to hemorrhoids alone. And suppose, if you got hemorrhoids, then it will not disappear without any medication. Do you have pain while passing stools? If it is so, then probably you have got fissure-in-ano, which is an ulcer in the anal canal. It will appear again and again without proper treatment. People often confuse it with hemorrhoids. It is due to constipation passing hard stools and less frequent stools. You may also get it after having a very spice diet, trauma and stress. You need to get a surgeons appointment and opinion.

Please help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I can understand your concern.
I went through the image the attachment removed to protect the patients identity.
If there was unprotected sex, one needs to think of sexually transmitted infection. So, I suggest you do the following tests.
1. TPHA Treponema pallidum hemagglutination test.
2. HPV PCR test human papillomavirus polymerase chain reaction.
3. Herpes simplex virus one and two antibodies tests.
4. Chlamydia trachomatis IgG antibody test.
5. Human immunodeficiency virus screening test.
6. Hepatitis B surface antigen test.
7. Urine complete test.
If not, it can be a simple bacterial infection. I suggest you use an antibacterial ointment for local application and take a tablet of Doxycycline tetracycline antibiotic 100 mg twice a day for 5 days. In case of a fungal infection, an antifungal ointment is suggested. Make sure you wash your genitalia twice daily and use normal water.
Kindly consult a specialist, talk with them, and take medicines with their consent.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern.
I appreciate your health concern chronic pancreatitis is a deficiency of pancreatic enzymes that may cause you to be unable to digest protein and fats in your food. In addition, oily stools may be due to the enzymes you take orally Panlipase that may not be sufficient to digest your consuming fats.  If fats are deficient, there is decreased absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, so vitamin deficiency happens. So you have to consume the above tablets.

"Hello doctor,
I am 66 years old. Three months back, I had a left L4-L5 Metrx microdiscectomy. A postoperative complication was STEMI with cardiogenic shock requiring emergency PCI with multiple Vfib arrests. I was given several drugs, that included Heparin, and hospitalized for 20 days.
I have pain and numbness in my left buttock region that is sometimes severe. Also, I occasionally have pain in my thighs and numbness and tingling in my left foot. My surgical scar has healed well, and I do not have back pain. I am able to sit however, standing and walking cause pain in the buttocks and legs. Also, I have numbness on the top of my right foot and saddle area, and there is no bowel or bladder incontinence. However, there is constipation sometimes. This discomfort has restricted me from doing any activity around the house, and I continue to use my walker at times as well. I have made significant lifestyle changes since my STEMI with diet, fluid restriction, and medications. My current medications include tablet Brilinta 180 mg, tablet Aspirin 81 mg, tablet Lasix 80 mg, tablet Carvedilol 12.5 mg, tablet Spironol 25 mg, tablet Losartan 25 mg, Potassium capsules, and fiber capsules. I have also been taking injection Novolog, 8 to16 units per day. I have been trying to reduce my insulin injections as I am gaining belly weight. My HbA1c is around 9 . I do not take any medications for pain and have taken Gabapentin capsules.
My neurosurgeon suggested I gradually increase my activity and referred me to physical therapy. However, my buttock and leg pain have not subsided. As a result, I do not do much lifting, bending, or twisting. I understand that these complaints may subside with time however, the symptoms are frustrating me.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern.
Ideally, after an L4-L5 matrix microdiscectomy, you should get pain relief. However, there can be limitations to L4-L5 surgery as it is one of the lowest weight-bearing discs of the body. There can still be chances of symptoms despite a successful surgery due to the body mechanics. I suggest you continue physical therapy and graded exercises to improve your quality of life. I also suggest you take capsule Pregabalin 75 mg or capsule Duloxetine 20 mg to 60 mg for neuropathic pain. Consult a specialist doctor, talk to him or her, and start the medicines with their consent. Also, a topical Gabapentin gel will be helpful. Please share your pre-operative and post-operative MRI magnetic resonance imaging lumbosacral spine for further advice.

My BP was 12766 mmHg yesterday.About four years ago, I used to get heat flashes on occasion when I started a ketogenic diet and was drinking pre-workout drinks regularly. I would feel a stomach or gastric disturbance, then a lightheaded feeling for just a second a couple of times daily. I stopped taking the supplements and pre-workout drinks, and it went away for some time. The company representative said it was probably a mineral imbalance and suggested some minerals. I went back to taking the supplements, and the symptoms returned, but this time I stayed off them going forward. I would get the hot flash occasionally when I drank anything with a lot of caffeine ever since. Somewhere around this time, I kept getting a bubble feeling in my stomach and lower GI, particularly when laying down, like gas but fluttering. I went to my primary care doctor, and she was worried it was a heart condition and did an EKG in the office, but it was normal. My lipase levels in my blood were slightly elevated 57 UL, so she wanted to do a full abdominal and upper GI CT. All came back normal, with a slight possibility of GERD. During my upper GI CT, they noted I had an SVT in the heart, so the GI doctor pushed me to go to a Cardiologist who did a complete EKG, stress test, and ultrasound and found no issues except the SVT. They then diagnosed AFIB. The Cardiologist wants to put me on the beta-blockers and something else, but I am hesitant due to a few issues I experienced in the past.I have had minor back issues for years with sciatica and lumbar soreness the CT scan noted some lumbar degeneration, along with a stiff neck issue that I have regularly corrected with the chiropractor. My neck stiffness got to the point that I had to buy a neck massager, which made it worse. I used to get a massage to loosen stiff muscles in my neck, but earlier this year, that became more painful clearly a nervous issue as I would be sore for a week afterward. I have a poor posture issue and sit at a desk all day. Also, I overworked my chest and caused some muscle imbalance, so I visited PT to help correct it, which helps sometimes but is still annoying. I have pins and needles randomly in my back not painful and some numbness in my toes, mainly when I lay down. I am not 100  certain the toes thing has not been going on for a long time. I am just hypersensitive to everything now. No loss of strength anywhere, as I lift weights very regularly. Also, I have had feelings of hazy or foggy headaches, tension headaches, and occasional vision issues. I had extensive eye tests last year because I had cupping in the optic nerve, but all tests came back normal with no pressure.Getting to my point. I have felt strongly that these things were connected for some time. I tried not to search on the internet. So, I went to a neck and spine specialist yesterday, and they took X-rays and scheduled MRI to look at the head and neck. X-ray reports seemed normal, but I was asked to wait on MRI. I do not know how to talk to a doctor about connecting these dots or if that is reasonable. Please help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I went through your query and understood your concern.
Regarding heat flashes, they could be partially explained by GERD gastroesophageal reflux disease and atrial fibrillation episodes. However, I suggest you check your thyroid hormone levels to exclude possible thyroid gland dysfunction, which may trigger hot flashes, cardiac arrhythmia, and pins and needles.
Regarding your stiff neck, with a normal X-ray study, it is much more probable that your MRI magnetic resonance imaging result will be normal too. A wrong posture may explain neck pain and stiffness.
Regarding the numbness in your toes, I suggest you to perform a nerve conduction study to examine your nerve activity and check for vitamin B12 and vitamin D plasma levels for possible deficiency. I suggest you discuss with your doctor on the above issues.
I hope this has helped you out.
Kindly follow up if you have more doubts.","{'score': 89, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 7, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 89, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}"
"Hi doctor,
I am experiencing some unusual issues with my menstrual cycle. Last month, instead of my period, I had spotting this month. I am feeling cramps, but I have not gotten my period yet. Based on my calculations, I should have started my period by now. I am feeling very worried about this. I have taken pregnancy tests using both test strips and blood tests, and they have come back negative.
Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Thank you for sharing your concerns regarding your menstrual cycle. Irregular periods and scanty menses could occur due to various reasons, including stress, recent illness, PCOS, or thyroid disorders. It is important to diagnose the underlying cause to start appropriate treatment.
I recommend a pelvic ultrasound USG pelvis to assess your reproductive systems health and check for any abnormalities or cysts. Additionally, a thyroid profile and complete blood count CBC should be done to rule out any thyroid abnormalities or anemia that could cause irregular periods.
Based on the findings of the tests, treatment can be planned accordingly. If polycystic ovary syndrome PCOS is suspected, medications like Metformin or hormonal therapy may be recommended. If thyroid abnormalities are found, thyroid hormone replacement therapy may be prescribed.
I understand that this can be a stressful situation for you, and please know that you can ask any further questions or concerns. It is always important to consult a healthcare provider to ensure a proper diagnosis and effective treatment.
Thank you.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 80, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,
I had an episode of severe palpitations early this year, following which I went through ECG, 2D echo, stress test, and troponin. All the tests were normal. I have been experiencing intermittent chest, neck, and back pain since two years. The doctor started with Nebicard SM 5 mg, which he recently halved to 2.5 mg. Both the cardiologists I visited, have ruled out the possibility of a cardiac problem. I am anxiety-prone. I often feel like I may die of a heart attack. The thoughts of death have increased in the past two weeks. My pulse rate seems to be between 55 to 65 bpm at rest and does not seem to rise beyond 80 bpm even while walking. The chest, neck, and back pain still persists. At times I feel dizzy, weak, and very occasionally feel short of breath.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern. Anxiety is widespread amongst healthy young adults these days. Most often, palpitation is not as a result of a heart problem. I usually advise my patients to engage in exercises like Yoga or deep breathing exercises. Getting adequate sleep of six to seven hours, avoiding coffee, alcohol, and smoking will help your situation. If you stick to these changes, there should be an improvement in four to six weeks. If you do not get better, you will have to see a psychologist.

"Hello doctor,
I am a 29 year old male. I recently took an online psychology test and found myself to be a dismissive-avoidant personality type. I took the test because everything is not fine in my life and I want some solution. I am single, and highly educated, managing my own business and live with my parents. These are the details about my life and problems happening. Personality I am an introvert and do not like attending social or family gatherings. The last time I attended any marriage party was twelve years ago of my brothers. I do not have any friends now and had few friends during college. I do not like waiting in line, crowded place or traveling much. I like to spend time alone, reading, listening to music, etc. I work from home alone since my nature of work is online and have not taken a break from work in the last five years. I am a kind of person who wants control, freedom, independence in life, very practical and live in the present. I hide many personal feelings and do not share them with others because for me it is a private matter. I feel like I trapped myself in a self-imposed social isolation and do not know how to come out of that. Family Mine is an upper-middle-class family. My elder sister and brother are married and stay outside. I am the youngest of the three and live with my parents. In childhood and adulthood, my relationship with my family members was good. As I got older and learned the real meaning of life, it feels like all the relationships are transactional in nature. They care for you till you have resources and once your money is over none care for you. I know parents care for you if you care for them and same is the case for siblings. Frankly speaking, I do not have a good relationship with anyone in the family. They do not like me due to my nature of living in own world and avoiding family gatherings. Relationships I had many failed relationships in the last ten years and most of them were long-distance. I have not yet gotten over the pain of my past breakups and some pain is still inside. It feels my heart is broken, but I am smiling to make myself and others happy. Some relationships did not sustain due to my partner not agreeing, family not agreeing, incompatibility in choices, etc. I moved from one broken relationship to another just to forget the breakup pain. Now, I am cold to relationships, have commitment problems, and feel like running away from responsibilities. I have taken decisions in life thinking about my career or goal without thinking about my partners feelings and the effect on the relationship. I am in another relationship now and thinking of marriage, but somehow my past breakups and personality issues are causing a problem. These are some queries I need your help with. Is there any problem in my personality or life? What is the solution to problems in my personality or life? Am I having a dismissive-avoidant personality issue?  What is the cure for dismissive-avoidant personality? What other suggestions would you like to give me? Looking forward your reply. Thank you.","Hello,

"Hi doctor,
My uncle had a high fever for a week, along with a cough, which gradually increased. After no improvements even after taking medicines, we admitted him to a hospital near our place, where they took a chest x-ray and did blood tests. They confirmed it as pneumonia, and he was put on oxygen support. He was also suspected for swine flu, so we were waiting for the reports. But gradually his lung functioning started to diminish. He showed partial pressure of oxygen PaO2 levels of 60 mmHg in arterial blood gas ABG at that time. But then we had a computed tomography CT scan of lungs, which showed bilateral infection. But the doctor treating him took it lightly, and he was waiting for the swine flu report. H1N1 came back negative, yet his breathing became a major problem. All this happened within two days. He does not smoke or drink. He had a problem in breathing when he visited a hill station. On the second night, he was almost closing his eyes with a fever of 101 degree and PaO2 level of 54 mmHg. He was shifted to an intensive care unit ICU and was put on non invasive ventilation NIV. The next morning he did not improve, and his PaO2 level was 45 mmHg. So, we shifted him to a better hospital, who again put him in an isolated ward, as they also suspected H1N1. But, they diagnosed it as atypical pneumonia, as other parameters were normal. He was put on a ventilator, but here also his H1N1 report was negative, but the pulmonologist said that the pictures depict swine flu. The team stated that he his struggling in ventilator too, but since all other vitals are stable they promised us that he would recover slowly. He was on a ventilator for seven days, on the eighth day, he was extubated and put on NIV fearing for ventilator associated pneumonia VAP. He sustained for 24 hours in NIV with great difficulty with diminishing PaO2 levels, and the respiratory element in monitor rose to 40. During this 24 hours, he was extremely drowsy, and he did not respond to us. He was restless and breathed with so much difficulty. The neurologist said that he is psychologically dull, as all his levels of electrolytes were normal. After this, tracheostomy was done, and he was intubated again. Now it is the third day he is on the stoma. He is in full artificial support now and not breathing naturally. A CT scan was taken yesterday. As he is not improving, the doctors are again suspecting swine flu, although the reports are negative. He is on antibiotics, so the infection did not spread, but the lungs are full of scars. Now, he does not have a fever. The hospital team is not able to give us answers as to why my uncles health is deteriorating. He is conscious, and other vitals are stable, but his breathing is null without artificial support. We need a second opinion. I am attaching the CT scan report taken 14 days back and also the one taken yesterday. And also attaching few ABG reports, taken two weeks back. Please give us an opinion on his health condition and what are the other steps we can take?","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com. I have gone through the reports attachment removed to protect patient identity and the details that you have given. His history and available investigations suggest the possibility of swine flu. Swine flu has many variants, and H1N1 is one of them. If H1N1 is negative, it does not mean that he does not have swine flu. At this point of time, the treatment isbroad spectrum antibiotics as well as ventilator support till he improves.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have read your concern. It could be gastroenteritis secondary to alcohol intake. If you have been on a pill for more than a month and this is your second pack, you have nothing to worry if you just missed out one pill. As most probably you have vomited out the pill, you can take another pill for today and then continue as once a day every day. You do not have to take a double pill. You will continue to be protected and just continue with the pack. The problem will only arise if you have not been consistently taking it, if you just missed it today because of the vomiting, it will not be too significant. For the vomiting, hydrate yourself and better to take Vitamin B and Advil Ibuprofen for your hangover.","{'score': 96, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

Floaters, photo after-images, ghost images are usually seen in disorders of the retina. Halos are indicative of corneal edema due to various reasons. There are a lot of diseases which can cause such a picture. At the same time, if you only experience these problems once in a while and have no problems with vision, you could actually have no treatable problems. The best and only way to confirm it for sure would be to visit an ophthalmologist. I would recommend an urgent visit in case you have pain, a sudden drop in vision, part of the image you see cannot be visualized or redness, watering, discharge from the eyes.  In case you do not have any of the above, I would say a non-urgent visit would suffice.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 92, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"

It looks like a minor aphthous ulcer, which gives no pain and subsides by itself. Please check if there is any pus discharge, pain in the tooth and any other area of the mouth also has this kind of spots. Aphthous ulcer often causes minimal symptoms or problems. Oral ulcers are small round or ovoid ulcers of two to four meter in diameter. They are round or ovoid in most situations but are often more linear in common site. They have an ulcer floor that is initially yellowish white and surrounded by an erythematous halo or redness. They are found mainly on the mobile mucosa of the lips, cheeks, the floor of the mouth, sulci or below the tongue. Yours is in between the junction of gums and sulcus of the cheek, so it is a soft mucosa looks like to be. They occur in groups of only a few ulcers that is, one to six at a time. In your case, you have one only. They heal in seven to ten days, and they may recur at intervals of one to four months. They leave little or no evidence of scarring. If it pains, then you can apply pain relieving gel.

"Hello doctor,I am a 45-year-old male, and the situation is unsettling. With the onset of flu season, there are reports of farmers culling their poultry due to concerns about avian flu. The issue in my area is the presence of migratory birds, as they either settle here for winter or travel to another counter through the route where I stay. While farmers can control their poultry within farms, the fear of avian flu transmission from these migratory birds is problematic. Please provide advice on how to stay safe in this situation. I appreciate your guidance. Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
We feel glad that you reached out to us.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC states that avian influenza, or bird flu, is caused by avian influenza flu type A viruses. These viruses naturally circulate among wild aquatic birds globally and can infect domestic poultry and other bird and animal species. While these viruses typically do not infect humans, rare human infections have been reported. The most common causes of severe bird flu worldwide are the Asian lineage H7N9 and highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses. Infected birds shed the flu virus through saliva, mucus, and feces. Human infections occur when the virus enters the eyes, nose, mouth, or respiratory tract through airborne transmission droplets or dust or by touching contaminated surfaces and the face.
I suggest the following for the prevention of avian flu
Please avoid direct contact with wild birds and observe them from afar.
Avoid unprotected contact with sick-looking or dead domestic birds poultry.
Be aware that wild birds can carry avian influenza A even without showing signs of illness.
Avoid touching surfaces contaminated with bird flu virus.
Change clothes before handling healthy domestic poultry or interacting with wild birds, dispose of gloves and face masks, and wash hands thoroughly afterward.
Follow the general protective measures suggested below
Use protective equipment like gloves, an N95 respirator, a well-fitting facemask, and eye protection.
Avoid touching the face after contact with birds or contaminated surfaces.
Practice hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water after touching birds.
These measures are reminiscent of those used during the COVID-19 pandemic.
I suggest you receive a seasonal flu vaccine annually, approximately two weeks before potential exposure, especially for those with potential exposure to sick birds. While this would not prevent bird flu infection, it can reduce the risk of simultaneous infection with human and bird flu viruses. Seasonal flu vaccines, such as FluQuadri Sodium chloride, dibasic sodium phosphate, monobasic sodium phosphate, water for injection, and traces of ovalbumin egg protein, Octoxinol-9, and Formaldehyde, protect against various influenza infections.
I suggest the following treatment plan
Antiviral medicines like Tamiflu Oseltamivir are available for treatment.
Antihistamines, such as Levocetirizine, can alleviate symptoms.
Antipyretics like Acetaminophen can reduce fever and should be used when the body temperature exceeds 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Consult your doctor and take the medicines accordingly.
I suggest consulting a doctor promptly if you experience symptoms like a cold, fever, sneezing, a runny or congested nose, and body aches.
I hope this helps.

"Hi doctor,
I am unsure about what has happened to my knee. I need a doctor to review my knee MRI. The doctor mentioned that I have an ACL disruption. What is the extent of the damage, and do I require surgery?  I need further information to determine if surgery is required or not.","Hi,
I am glad you chose icliniq for your medical-related queries.
I understand your concern.
I have reviewed the attached MRI magnetic resonance imaging images of your knee attachment removed to protect the patients identity, and there is an anterior cruciate ligament injury that has been indicated as a disruption by your doctors. It is not a complete tear but a high-grade partial disruption is likely. The ligament injury in your knee is of moderate intensity, and the decision regarding surgical management depends on any fractures in the area of ligament attachments and clinical mobility at the knee, considering factors like your age and athletic profile. If there is a grade II or III pivot shift during clinical examination and increased ligament laxity, then surgery is recommended. If you are involved in athletic activities, then surgery might be recommended by most doctors. If you are not participating in extensive athletics or sports, then you can wait for recovery and observe the outcome.
Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

"Hello doctor,Last night I had oral sex with my HIV-affected aunt, but I was using a condom. She sucked my penis and she spitted on my leg. After that, she removed the condom with her hands touching the foreskin of my penis. Am I in a danger zone?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I read your query and understand your concern.
It seems from your query that you received oral sex from a woman who is HIV human immunodeficiency virus infected. This sexual act of receiving oral sex carries a negligible risk, as there is no exchange of body fluids. Also, I would like to mention that, saliva has enzymes that kill HIV. For HIV to transmit, there needs to be body fluid, which is there with anal or vaginal intercourse and there is direct entry of the virus into the bloodstream. HIV can not be transmitted by touching HIV infected person. The chances of an HIV-negative person acquiring HIV from oral sex are extremely low. There are various local factors that may increase the risk which include
Sores in the mouth.
Bleeding gums.
Presence of other sexually transmitted infections.
The other factor on which transmission risk is dependent is whether the HIV-infected person is taking antiretrovirals regularly and the existing HIV viral load. In your case, the risk is non-existent as a condom was used. So, you are not in the danger zone. Relax, at the same time, I suggest there is no harm in knowing your baseline HIV status. For this, you need to undergo HIV rapid test at any accredited laboratory and the results are given in just 20 minutes.
I hope this helps you.

The biopsy report is suggestive of moderate cancer as per Gleasons score, but if we consider the bone scan to be confirmative of metastasis, then it will be labeled as advanced prostate cancer. Hormone therapyhas been found to be helpful, but can prolong life up to 24 to 36 months in advanced case. Regarding the genetic linkage of the disease, prostate cancer is more common in males with a strong family history of prostate cancer. People who smoke, black males and patients who consume a diet high in animal fat or chromium are at increased risk for this disease. Your report as of today is normal, but if you get symptoms of prostatic enlargement, do go for a regular PSA test prostate specific antigen.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}"
"Hi doctor,
I have been experiencing a transparent discharge that is foul smelling and, which with varied treatment, only reduced to a certain extent but never disappeared. There is an itching present. I faced this issue during the last menstruation, and I realized that the discharge was abnormal. STD tests and thyroid tests are normal. A colposcopy of the cervix and vagina showed greater than 30, abundant mucus, and gram-negative cocci. The discharge was thick initially, and the color was yellow, green, and then white. To regularize my period, I was given Cyclodinon.
I was put on a Lactobacillus intravaginal and Chlorhexidine combination, after which the symptom reduced, but discharge with odor started again. My doctor then gave me a drug for Candida as I had itching. Before the colposcopy on the bimanual examination, cervical ectropion was detected, which was reduced when I went for the recent appointment. I am 22 years old. Kindly help since it is interfering with my lifestyle.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I am here to give you the best medical advice.
I can understand how your condition could be quite distressing. I went through your reports attachments removed to protect the patients identity and your history as well. You have already received antifungal treatment so maybe you can shift to antibiotics like Doxycycline and Metronidazole Metrogyl which may offer some relief. Also, in prolonged situations, I suggest you get sugar and urine checked as well. Also, do a routine PAP Papanicolaou test smear every three months. Maintain proper hygiene and I suggest you do the following
Change your undergarments regularly at least twice daily. Wearing soft cotton fabric might help you feel better.
Wear loose clothes.
If involved in sexual intercourse, use barrier contraceptives like condoms.
Change your lifestyle by following a healthy diet and drinking lots of water.
Add probiotics.
This process requires patience and regular follow-up, so keep track.
I hope I have resolved all your queries. Do let me know if you have any other questions.

"Hi doctor,
Can crying a lot make a hiatal hernia bigger? I have been crying a lot, and I feel like it is irritable or something. I am burping a lot and feel nauseous. Kindly give your opinion.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
In general, crying does not worsen it or have very little effect. However, it depends on how hard one is crying. If one is crying very hard, which involves abdominal straining or coughing, then it can worsen hiatal hernia. So basically, anything involving a rise in intra-abdominal or intra-thoracic pressure like coughing or straining, crying out loud can cause worsening of hiatal hernia. Otherwise, simple crying unlikely to affect it. However, crying due to psychological effects can increase acid production or reflux, leading to worsening of the symptoms. So try to control it as much as possible. You can take antacids like Pantoprazole with Domperidone combination or other whenever needed if you are not having one. I hope this was helpful.

Kindly help.
Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I went through your query, a history of bleeding around 30 weeks with the low-lying placenta and abdominal cramps is alarming. Placenta, if found within two cm of the internal cervical os, is considered a low-lying placenta. The low-lying placenta is extremely dangerous if it covers the internal os and has a higher chance of bleeding. Minor bleeding can be proceeded by heavy life-threatening bleeding. You have to have restricted movements and activities as there are chances of bleeding anytime. If you are experiencing other symptoms or problems like high blood pressure, or diabetes, it needs to be checked and treated completely. If this is your first pregnancy, you might not know about the normal body changes for labor preparation. You might have mild irritation at the lower abdomen but better differentiate it from labor pain that comes from the back to the lower abdomen and gradually increases in intensity. You should check for bloody vaginal discharge, dizziness, fainting, or reduced baby movements and report to the hospital in an emergency.

You have been prescribed Metformin drug for your case which is prescribed in case of PCOD to decrease glucose level and to regularize the period. If needed, a hormonal pill also can be prescribed.
Clomiphene citrate helps in inducing ovulation. So, continue taking the prescribed medication and try to reduce weight if you are obese. Regular exercise will also be beneficial in your case.
Take a healthy diet and more fruits.
Try to have intercourse especially around ovulation time at around 14 days of menstruation cycle. If you do not get pregnant in a few months, then a USG scan study should be done to detect ovulation and Clomiphene can be prescribed If needed.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Looking at your description of symptoms, it seems that you have irritable bowel syndrome, which is a common condition of the hypersensitive gut that causes pain, altered bowel habits, diarrhea in some, and constipation in others.
But I want some more pertinent information before jumping to establish this diagnosis. Since irritable bowel syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion, there is no other condition or disease that could explain your symptoms.
Kindly answer my following questions.
What do you mean by diarrhea?
Are these loose or unformed stools increased in frequency that is more than three times in a day?
Are the stools large or small in volume?
Does a large volume mean more than 250 to 300 ml a full glass of water?
Do you feel a repetitive urge to pass stools, but nothing comes really?
Have you lost weight in the last six to eight months?
Do you ever notice blood in stools?
Do you have a family history of colon, stomach, or abdominal cancers?
Do you feel any particular food causing this, like milk or wheat or whole wheat or whole grain or nuts or fish?
Do you ever been told that you have food allergies or milk intolerance?
Do you feel this cramp-like pain resolve after you pass stools?
Do you have these cramp or bowel movements troubled you in the middle of the night while asleep?
Do you smoke or use alcohol?
I would appreciate it if you could provide me the above information. It will help us to establish that it is IBS irritable bowel syndrome or anything else.

Since your dog is fully vaccinated for rabies as per your narrative, vaccinating yourself may not be needed.

"Hello doctor,Does the mole on my shoulder look concerning? I have had it since childhood. It is flat and has not grown in size. What to do?Please help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Based on the information you provided, the mole on your shoulder does not seem concerning. Moles that have been present since childhood and have not changed in size, shape, or color are generally considered benign non-cancerous.
However, it is essential to have any new or changing moles evaluated by a healthcare provider, as some malignant cancerous moles may also appear suddenly or grow slowly over time. If you notice any changes in the mole, such as asymmetry, irregular borders, color variation, or a change in size or elevation, you should schedule an appointment with a dermatologist for further evaluation.
In the meantime, it is recommended to perform regular self-examinations of your skin to monitor any new or existing moles. If you have concerns about your skin health or anxiety related to skin conditions, you may also consider speaking with a mental health professional to help manage your symptoms.
Hope it helps.

My TSH thyroid-stimulating hormone levels are 5.2, but My FT3 free Triiodothyronine is at 4.8, and my FT4 free Thyroxine is at 13.5.

Firstly congratulations on your pregnancy.
In the first three months of your pregnancy First trimester, your TSH levels should be less than 2.5 irrespective of t4 and t3 levels . This level is required for the normal development of the babys thyroid and nervous system and also for the continuation of the pregnancy. Hence any imbalance in these levels can lead to complications like miscarriages, hypothyroidism, neural defects in the baby, and preterm delivery. Since your TSH level is 5.2 high, your doctor has prescribed 50 mcg of Levothyroxine.
I suggest you kindly take the medication and follow up on your TSH levels regularly as per the doctors advice.

Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I completely understand your concern about Alzheimers disease AD regarding your family history. The relationship between tobacco and AD is complicated. The majority of research shows that tobacco itself does not increase the AD risk, and at least one study showed that it may decrease the risk however, the last mentioned one was sponsored by a cigarette-making industry. On the other hand, people usually use AD for all forms of dementia. Unfortunately, this error even occurs in some family physicians.
There are multiple forms of dementia. AD is the most prevalent among the elderly. Nevertheless, the second most prevalent dementia is vascular dementia VD. There is plenty of evidence that smoking increases the risk of VD significantly. Accordingly, the general risk of smoking for well-being and especially for VD outweighs its minor neutral effect for AD.
I hope this helps you.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I am assuming, based on the drugs, you are in your middle ages. Without knowing your medical condition and why are you on Clopidogrel, I am assuming that you may have a cardiac condition that needs anti-platelet medicines.

Please note there is no absolute contraindication of taking these two drugs together as long as your doctor is aware, then all that is needed is to take the two and have your coagulation profile, including bleeding time checked for the first two to three weeks. Theoretically, glucosamine may increase the risk of bleeding. People with bleeding disorders, those taking anti-clotting or anti-platelet medication such as Warfarin, Clopidogrel, and Ticlid, or people taking supplements that may increase the risk of bleeding should not take glucosamine unless under the supervision of a healthcare provider.","{'score': 96, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"

I have read your query and I understand your concern. The chances of you contracting the infection from an undergarment are almost nil. I will state the reasons for this. First of all, the bacteria and viruses die within 72 hours after coming in contact with a cloth surface. Even if it was infected, the infection would have gone as I  am sure you would have received the undergarment 72 hours after someone wore it.
Secondly, chances of you receiving a used undergarment from a good online shopping site is less.
Thirdly, it is not necessary that the cuts in the skin came in contact with that part of the undergarment which carried the infection.

Mostly it will be an anal fissure and not cancer. The symptoms you have told me are all consistent with fissures. You must avoid constipation at all costs. I suggest you take plenty of fluids and water daily with lots of fibrous foods, fruits, and vegetables. Avoid spicy and fried foods. Get a professional consultation in person. You may be advised to use some local ointment to soothe and relieve the pain. You may also be asked to take a sitz bath.","{'score': 91, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 7, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 86, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,
I was suffering from severe pain in the lower abdomen and testicle swelling and pain. I ran to a urologist immediately and got an abdomen scan and scrotum scan done. It is mentioned that the left testis is enlarged, and no flow is seen on the Doppler. It is mentioned that epididymo-orchitis with mild hydrocele. I am taking prescribed antibiotics and painkillers. I can walk and sit, but swelling and pain in the testis still exist if I touch. Could you please help me with your opinion on this problem?","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Good that you get in touch with us. I am sorry to learn about your condition. I read your sonography report attachments removed to protect the patients identity very carefully, and I am not too happy with the diagnosis. An early cancerous process which would be 99 curable cannot be ruled out with these findings. Therefore you have to get at least two sonographic follow-ups after ten days and 21 days minimum. In case the heterogenous lesion would still be there, a biopsy is mandatory to rule out testicular cancer. It is urgent because this disease normally develops rapidly and can only be fully cured when treated in stage one. I wish you good results.","{'score': 85, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 7, 'transparency': 8}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,
I am 64 years old. I am a heavy drinker for 30 years and had SCA two years ago. I also had an AICD implant and on Dytor 10, Flavidon, Cordarone 200, Xeralto 15, and Xtor 10. My HR is 60, EF is 45, and LV grade 2 dysfunction with LV hypertrophy. I do cardiac exercise biking 8 km per day in 40 minutes. For the last 1.5 years, I have had left sided chest pain radiating to the back below the shoulder blade. It comes and goes off suddenly, and I do not get any relief from Ultracet. I do not have any other symptoms. My renal function and other parameters are normal, with no episodes of arrhythmia. I consulted two cardiologists, and they said it is noncardiac. I feel very uncomfortable when the pain starts. My HR after exercise is 95 and comes down to 75 after one minute. Please advise.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Did you ever undergo angiography or CT coronary angiography to look for the status of the vessel? Was your sudden cardiac arrest attributed to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy? Please share your echo report as well. Now regarding your pain, it does not show the characteristics of cardiac pain. Cardiac chest pain classically occurs on exercises and relieves with rest. Such intermittent rest pain are usually noncardiac. Also, cardiac pain usually does not persist for 12 hours unless it is a heart attack, which would be very evident on echo or ECG electrocardiography. Also, one cannot have a heart attack so frequently. Now regarding the probable cause, two likely possibilities are gastric reflux and spinal pain. Do you have any other gastric symptoms like bloating, burping, heartburn, or epigastric pain? If yes, then it supports reflux. Even otherwise, it can be acid reflux. You should have the trial of antacids like Pantoprazole, Domperidone, and also topical antacids like Sucral-O whenever symptomatic. Now another possibility is spinal pain. Now, does this pain increase on movements? Or is there any tingling numbness or band-like sensation over the chest? If yes, then it supports the possibility of spinal pain. Can you recall any precipitating factor like weight lifting, prolonged standing, or abnormal sleep posture? However, the possibility of cardiac pain still should also be ruled out on investigations like CT coronary tomography or stress test if not had recently. I hope this helps.","{'score': 83, 'clinical_accuracy': 15, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 6, 'transparency': 8}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"

I understand your concern. Lymph nodes are significant when their size is more than 1-1.5 cm. You do not have to be anxious about anything. I would like to know whether you have any loss of appetite. This is just to rule out some conditions. Sometimes lymph node enlargement can also occur because of an unhealthy diet. I would suggest you to add more proteins to diet and eat healthy to maintain a good immune system.

I reviewed your history. These symptoms indicate dryness of eyes. Symptomatic relief can be obtained by use of artificial tear eye drops. I would suggest to use artificial eye drops like Refresh tears Carboxymethylcellulose Sodium one drop 2-3 times a day. Along with this, I would suggest you to avoid continuous use of computer screen or monitor for long continuous hours. Take frequent breaks in between. Since you are having sudden onset of blurred vision, I would suggest you to go for basic eye examination with your ophthalmologist or optometrist in the form of vision testing and fundus examination.

"Hello doctor,
I am a 26 years old male. I have had anxiety for six years now and panic attacks from even before. I have been feeling dizzy for a week now all day, a little bit of pressure on my head. I have alternate periods of sweating and chills. I have been to the hospital a few times because I thought I have cancer. And, they did some CT scan and blood tests and said I have anxiety and to avoid self-diagnosing. My question is, can my anxiety and stress make me feel dizzy or is something really wrong with me? I am really scared. Please provide me details about the symptoms of anxiety and stress.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I can understand your concern. Yes, anxiety could present with symptoms like dizziness, increased sweating, and negative thoughts. Anxiety causes the activation of the sympathetic nervous system and thus present with these symptoms. Sweating is one of the most common symptoms of anxiety. After reading your brief history, it appears that you have an anxiety relating to a health condition. The fear of having some serious illness, researching repeatedly on the internet sources, persisting anxiety despite reassurances, all investigations coming back normal, etc. are the common presenting features of health anxiety or hypochondriasis. CT scan can very well detect most of the serious issues of the brain, and that has come back normal.  So, there is nothing to be worried about. Just relax. You are 26, and this is not the age you get cancer commonly. The anxiety is due to fear of illness or health anxiety. To come out of this anxiety, stop paying attention to minor symptoms you have like a mild headache, dizziness, fainting like symptoms, trembling, sweating, etc. These symptoms are seen more commonly in anxiety. You never had any symptoms like sudden severe headache, seizures, weakness of limbs, etc. You are giving too much attention to mild symptoms which need to be ignored. Also, stop repeatedly searching on internet resources about an illness again and again. Just reassure yourself that you have anxiety only. The symptoms are not due to cancer. I hope you understood. Thanks and Take care. You are welcome to ask follow-up doubts. Thank you.","{'score': 96, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

With unprotected sex pregnancy can happen. Pregnancy test does not come positive after five days of intercourse. You need to do one ultrasound for confirmation about pregnancy and how much growth is there and  where is it growing. According to that, we will decide how to abort. But if the baby is live then every country has its own laws about abortion. So you have to consult a nearby gynecologist or abortion center, and follow the proper guidelines according to the doctor and local laws for effective and safe abortion.

I currently on Neurontin, Cymbalta and blood pressure medicines. During the initial days of pain, I had a throat checkup, head scan and a few blood tests.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com. The pattern of pain youre describing is likely attributed to one of the following possibilities. It could be nerve irritation, referred to as cervical radiculopathy, stemming from compression or irritation of a nerve root of the neck. This may be accompanied by numbness. Another potential cause is disc herniation between the C2 and T2 vertebrae, resulting in nerve compression. This region contains nerve roots supplying the diaphragm and includes interactions with the neck, head, upper chest, and armpits. A less common consideration is a Pancoast tumor, which affects the uppermost part of the lung and can also lead to cervical nerve root compression. I recommend seeking evaluation from a neurologist for a comprehensive examination. Additionally, a CT scan of the cervical vertebrae and chest is advised to rule out the aforementioned causes.","{'score': 84, 'clinical_accuracy': 16, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 7, 'transparency': 8}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"

As you have taken the emergency contraceptive pill within 72 hours of intercourse, and already had the withdrawal bleeding, there is no chance of pregnancy. So, there is nothing to worry about.

"Hi doctor,
I am a female. My mother and I have the same dental issues. My teeth have cavities, and they break.
Other medical issues are acid reflux, fear of vomiting, anxiety at the dentist I usually get prescribed a particular Benzodiazepine when I go, PTSD Post-traumatic stress disorder is unrelated to dentistry.
I was born missing five or six adult teeth, while my mom was born missing four teeth. My mom eventually had to have all of her teeth crowned. Recently, she was diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and we are waiting for a geneticist to see what specific type. Congenitally missing teeth is a common trait of people with EDS, and with that and a few other symptoms in mind, it is highly suspected that I have it too. I had mid-wisdom teeth removal and dental stitches several times with no issues. I also have TMJ disorder and clench my teeth, but I do not know if I grind them at night.
The point is that my teeth are doomed. Since we now know, I would have to go in and rebuild all teeth in my mouth. My dentist recommended I look into getting implants. The top arch of my mouth is especially bad, and it hurts. I have a plan for my mouth, but unfortunately, the soonest I can do this procedure is around February. I  do not know which teeth are hurting me, and even if I did, I could not afford to fix these teeth just in the interim.
So how can I deal with this pain while waiting for this procedure?
I have strong pain tolerance, but my current baseline is about two. However, it can suddenly spike up to an eight, causing me to continuously take four Ibuprofen and two Acetaminophen pills every six hours my doctor said it is safe. I do not want to take any opioids if possible because most do not work for me for the whole four to six hours, and asking for stronger drugs raises suspicions, and I also do not want to be addicted to pain medicines.
Is there anything I can do besides clove oil, OTC painkillers, and Benzocaine?
And if the answer is no, could a dentist do anything other than prescribe painkillers?
Thank you.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have gone through your question, and I can understand your concern.
Dental pain is usually non-localized because the brains pain center can not identify the same, so the pain looks like the one you feel.
Now coming to your query, you need to answer certain questions like
Do you have cavities in your teeth, the painful ones?
As you said, you have missing teeth. But are they symmetrical missing from both sides or only single?
Upload the picture of your arches, both upper and lower, and mention precisely the questions too.
The TMJ temporomandibular joint pain and a clicking sound are also because of malocclusion and missing teeth. The stress you have on muscles of mastication also gives you severe pain.
You may need antibiotics and muscle relaxants because NSAID non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs painkillers alone are not the treatment for such complicated situations.
EDS Ehlers-Danlos syndrome will not hamper your normal life, especially when cardiovascular and visual systems are unaffected.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have reviewed your case history and attached laboratory values attachments removed to protect the patients identity in detail. My inference is as follows
A swollen upper thigh with significantly raised CRP C-reactive protein and white blood cells on a complete blood profile is indicative of ongoing severe inflammatory or infective process and this needs to be checked for cellulitis or thigh abscess.
Other issues could be due to uncontrolled diabetes, as indicated by raised HbA1c glycated hemoglobin values.
Liver enzymes and GGT gamma-glutamyl transferase are raised when compared to other enzymes, which is suggestive of either fatty liver or alcohol-induced fatty liver if the history of alcohol consumption is positive.
Painkillers are fine, but he might need antibiotics to treat his raised CRP and white blood cell counts.

I am currently taking Fluvoxamine 200 mg at night, Risperidone 2 mg       at night, and Modafinil 100 mg in the morning. It has been well controlled for more than four months now. 90 reduction in symptoms.
For the past two days, I have not been able to sleep because I have been seeing  shadows moving at the periphery of my vision. It scares me so much and when I try to close my eyes I can hear certain noises like laughter or someone moving  around. This only happens when it is mostly dark at night. For this reason, I have not  slept the first night and somehow fall asleep very late 3 AM the second night. Can you tell me what is causing this?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
What you are experiencing is called hypnogogic hallucinations which occur normally when sleeping sometimes, but in your case, it is due to the Modafinil. It is known to interfere with sleep and also cause hallucinations. Also, the metabolism will be slowed by Fluvoxamine and it lasts longer. You should not take it.
It does not affect OCD obsessive compulsive disorder and I would just advise you to stick to Fluvoxamine and Risperidone and if possible, do some sessions of CBT cognitive behavioral therapy from a clinical psychologist.
Also, it is advisable to not suddenly reduce the Modafinil, but taper it slowly. Take 150 mg for three or four days. Then 100 mg for a week and then 50 mg and then stop.
Also, with 90 percent improvement, you can consider either reducing the dose of Fluvoxamine or also try taking 50 mg in the morning and 150 mg at night, instead of 200 mg all at once. It will give you better results.","{'score': 68, 'clinical_accuracy': 15, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 5, 'transparency': 7}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,
Someone with a cold sore kissed my preemie baby, and she has been spitting her bottle out and crying what should I do?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Your baby seems to be on oxygen. You have not mentioned how old is the baby? For how long she has been in the hospital and are there any other problems with the baby. Or was she because she came into contact with a cold sore? Cold sore infection can sometimes lead to contamination of the mouth or lungs, occasionally other organs like brain, etc. It depends on the extent of the spread of infection and the severity.
Being a preemie preterm birth always puts babies at risk of disease. Your baby needs injectable antibiotic medication for the cold sores, for a specific duration depending on the extent. If vomiting is because of it, it will gradually subside. If she is spitting up due to other causes, which can happen on the premises, your doctor would explain that. The sores are painful, and some topical applications would be useful to relieve the pain. You can discuss the extant of infection with your treating doctor.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 95, 'clinical_accuracy': 19, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}"
"Hello doctor,
Me and my partner had sex last month. My penis just touched her vagina for 10 to 20 seconds but there was no ejaculation. Then I shifted my penis onto her abdomen and ejaculated on her belly. She has a regular cycle of 28 to 30 days with no history of PCOS. What are the chances of pregnancy? She did not take contraceptive medicines. I checked there was no semen on her vagina or thighs. And we wiped the semen that was on her belly.
Kindly help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
As the intercourse has happened on the 16th day of the cycle, the chances of pregnancy are very much there. As you have not taken any contraception like the I-pill Levonorgestrel which is the emergency contraception or condom the chances of pregnancy are always there. I would suggest you get a urine pregnancy test done if the periods have been delayed by 2 to 3 days so an immediate measure can be taken.

"Hello doctor.
I have had PVC, but I feel them ten times in an entire year. For example, I will have a month with no PVC, and in a couple of days, I will have 200 to 400 PVC. They are really scary, and the feeling is very unpleasant. But the most concerning thing is that in the last 3 to 4 months. It feels like strong squeeze and pressure feeling in my chest with little physical activity and even while talking. It is so bad that I have to lay down in bed for several hours for the pain to reduce. I did ten echos. I even did two CMR and stress tests and a lot of ECG, but nothing was found. I did a CT lung, but nothing was found. I still have this pain it is killing me, and it is not on a psychological level because a psyche doctor said that it does come with the symptoms. So something is really wrong. Currently, I am taking Propranolol beta blocker 3x 10mg. Are they maybe missing something? Is it a heart problem that can go underdiagnosed? Is it the Propranolol making this feeling even though I take it to lessen my PVCs? Please help me.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
With normal ECG electrocardiogram, echo echocardiogram, CMR cardiovascular magnetic resonance , and stress test, these are likely to be idiopathic PVCs premature ventricular contractions only. Having undergone so many tests, it is unlikely to miss any major cardiac illness. PVCs can be symptomatic and troublesome and are likely responsible for your symptoms. Now, in my opinion, some treatment modifications should be done in order to keep them suppressed. As current Propranolol is not helping, the dose of Propranolol can be increased if pulse rate or blood pressure permits. Also, if you are not taking it on a regular basis, then you should have Propranolol on a regular basis long-acting formulation of Propranolol. If propranolol or beta blockers are not helping, then calcium channel blockers or other antiarrhythmics should be tried as you are quite symptomatic. Controlling PVCs with medicines will help in the resolution of your symptoms, and later medications may be tapered off. You can also observe precipitating factors like caffeinated drinks, coffee, or any addiction, if any. So, in a nutshell, they are probably not missing anything, and these are likely idiopathic PVCs. Optimization of medicine appears to be the next most appropriate option in your case. These PVCs can go away with time. These PVCs certainly must be giving you anxiety, so reassurance and antianxiety meditation and yoga should also be tried. Hope this helps you, and get back if you have any more doubts or more information to share.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,
Recently I have been experiencing a slight burning sensation on the tip of my penis. When I pee, it stings a bit. The stinging sensation is subtle, but there is always a slight urge to pee. It feels like something is streaming down, but I can only feel it when it reaches close to the head of my penis. I am uncircumcised and I notice a white substance that seems to be, what I feel is, dripping down. I have not had sex in a while and if I did, it was always protected. I thought it might be due to lack of hydration. So, I have started to drink more water. I was told that cranberry juice works, which I started drinking today. My pee stream is slightly weaker, but the color is normal. Any advice? I thought it might be an infection but I do not want to jump to conclusions yet.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Considering your history,  the burning sensation might be because of an infection, or due to narrowing of the urine pipe, a condition called as stricture urethra. I suggest you to get the tests done to rule out an infection which are, urine routine, urine culture and sensitivity, ultrasound abdomen, and uroflowmetry. If you do not want to undergo these tests at present, the other option is to have an antibiotic trial for seven days considering an infection. If it is an infection, it should resolve with these tablet Doxycycline 100 mg morning and evening for seven days, tablet Pan 40 mg in the morning for seven days, and tablet Flavospas, one tablet at morning and evening for seven days. Continue with the cranberry juice or tablets.","{'score': 95, 'clinical_accuracy': 19, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 7, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,
I am a 19-year-old female. Almost every time I stand up or sit up I get extremely dizzy and lose all eyesight, and everything looks like a tv that lost signal. I also lose most of my hearing and there is also ringing noises in my ear. After a few minutes I can see again, but I get about 20 seconds of an excruciating migraine.  I usually have to hold on to something, because I almost always lose balance. There have also been a few episodes while just sitting down, I get blackouts. It is just the same as described in the ones when I get while I stand up, but about 20 times longer and I constantly fall and cannot stand or see absolutely anything in those cases. That episode lasts for about half an hour.
I have had the constant spells when I stand up a few times daily at least for the past couple of years and thought they would decrease by now, but the bad spells that I get have become more frequent in the past few months, once every two weeks or so. I have not had any injuries in the past few years, so I have no clue what could be going on. It is starting to really concern me. Also, when I am exposed to the color white or yellow my color in my vision  changes and I start to see different colors. I have no idea if that is related but I have had those for years.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Frequent chronic headaches are most commonly due to
1. Migraine headache.
2. Chronic tension headache.
Migraine headaches are usually unilateral, associated with throbbing, vomiting sensations, photophobia, and phonophobia.
Chronic tension headaches usually present with heaviness in head, band-like sensation over the head with sleeping difficulties. Important here is to differentiate between the two.
A clinical examination especially neurological examination, fundus examination are must to rule out any other neurological problem which might also require neuroimaging. You should see your doctor. He will classify the headache and if it is migrainous, treatment would be with drugs like Flunarizine, Propanolol, Amitryptyline.
Tension Headaches are treated with Amitryptilline, Escitalopram with behavioral modification treatment.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
You are exercising just after taking food. Your meal timings are also inappropriate.
For your blood pressure, I suggest you to evaluate the BP blood pressure recordings in calm and quiet surroundings for three alternate days. This can be just white-coat hypertension.
Also, do a baseline ECG electrocardiogram.
Till then, I suggest you follow a few lifestyle modifications like a salt-restricted diet, meditation, following proper food timings, and seven hours of sleep will help you.
In asthma patients, exercise increases breathlessness. You should take medications before exercising, and if there is severe breathlessness, contact your nearby hospital immediately.

"Hello doctor,
I am engaging in vaginal intercourse for the first time. I have tried a couple of times, but I get a bit too anxious and failed. I could not get a completely erect penis. One time I did not get any erection at all. I am sure I do not have an erectile disorder because I get a completely erect penis during masturbation. Any suggestions on how to overcome this anxiety? I am 30 years old and weigh 152.1 pounds, and my height is five feet 6 inches.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I read your query and understand your concerns. First of all, I like to inform you that one can handle performance anxiety with the use of the right psychotherapeutic approach. In my own experience, around 70 to 80  of individuals report dramatic improvement in erections once the psychotherapy is started leading to decrease in performance anxiety. Below here I am delineating few of the strategies which will help you in the problem.
Firstly get rid of thoughts that you may be sexually inadequate or your doubts that you may not be able to perform properly. This is because performance anxiety, feelings of sexual inadequacy, self-doubts, guilt, past negative sexual experiences, poor communication or misunderstanding with the partner, etc., can all affect sexual functioning and performance. Removing such ideas will eliminate the majority of causes for your poor sexual performance. Removing the persons doubts and fears, and improving his self-confidence levels will help in improving sexual performance. Remember that sex is not just a physical act but also a psychological process involving the expression of emotions, intimacy, and love.
So, just involve yourself in those feelings and stop focusing on your performance alone. Once you do that, then I assure you that your sexual performance will automatically improve. Most importantly, performance anxiety soon becomes a vicious cycle that is, anxiety leads to poor performance, and poor performance then leads to further anxiety, and this keeps on increasing. One more problem responsible for performance anxiety is inadequate sexual arousal. When the person is not properly aroused, the blood flow to the penis is not maximal, and so, after a few strokes, the erection weakens, and ejaculation occurs. The way to tackle this is not to rush into intercourse quickly but wait till you get fully aroused. So, increase and spice-up your foreplay. Make sure that you initiate penetration only after both of you are fully turned on. Good foreplay not only arouses you but also sparks off the mood in your partner. So, when she is also aroused and involved, then things keep flowing smoothly and effortlessly, and you do not have to be constantly anxious if you satisfy your partner or not. Distract yourself and stop monitoring your sexual performance. Try putting on some romantic music or mild lighting while you make love. Think about the things that turn you on. Taking your mind off of your sexual performance can remove the worries that are stopping you from getting fully aroused. Wish you all the best for your sexual health. I hope this helps you. If you have any further query, I would be glad to help you.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,
The patient is a 17-year-old male with 61 in height and 185 pounds weight. The primary doctor ordered an ECG and an echocardiogram because of a couple of episodes of near syncope recently. The episodes occur after sudden standing, and we were told it might be due to dehydration and orthostatic hypotension. There is no loss of consciousness and not under any medications. Blood pressure and pulse are listed below. The details of the echo cardiogram are below. The ECG was normal. The echocardiogram reported the following. Borderline asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy 1.2 cm, Borderline enlarged LVOT LVOT 2.2 cm LVOT velocity 1.97 msec, Increased mitral valve E to A ratio, consistent with the patients age, Trace-mild pulmonic valve regurgitation, there is an abnormal mosaic pattern over the pulmonic valve areas during the color flow Doppler examination and normal left ventricular, right ventricular, left atrial and aortic root diameters. The ECG is normal. BP when sitting is typically 11061 mmHg, with a heart rate between 58 and 64 beats per minute. BP, when lying down, is 8743 mmHg, with a heart rate between 42 and 45 beats per minute. My questions are what does the echocardiogram mean? What is this likely to be? Is it of short term or long term concern? What is the least aggressive treatment option? What is the most aggressive treatment option?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy HCM is a condition in which there is asymmetrical septal hypertrophy. LVOT left ventricular outflow velocity velocity is 1.97ms, so there is no LVOT obstruction. For the long term, we need to do a follow-up echo to see for any increase in the thickness of septum. For a short time, you may need a few more tests for risk stratification like Holter test, tilt table test, and genetic testing for HCM if available. Treatment options for orthostatic hypotension are increased salt intake, avoiding prolonged standing, few drugs like Fludrocortisone. Aggressive treatment options will depend upon tests reports that are suggested in the first paragraph. The mosaic pattern over the pulmonary valve needs to be correlated with the anatomy of the pulmonary valve and velocity across the pulmonary valve, which is not provided in details.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 7, 'transparency': 9}"
"Hi doctor,I am a 17 year old female struggling hard with bulimia and binge eating. My mom is anorexic, and so is my grandmother.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
According to your height, your weight is average. In bulimia, CBT cognitive behavioral therapy is helpful. If Prozac Fluoxetine is not working, then you have to increase the dose of Prozac or shift to another medicine. It is a learning process so that you have to change this to a better one. Continuous thought of purge will come to mind, but you have to stop the though by not reacting to that. Have patience because learning is a prolonged process and as age grows it is challenging to change the previous learning method. You can respond in another way rather than purging.

"Hello doctor,
I am a 25 year old who weighs 165 lbs, and my height is 5 foot 4 inches. Seven years earlier, I had a fever and constipation for three straight days. The fever resolved but since then, I have abnormal bowel movements. I also had a distended liver, but that is normal now.
My stools always seem greasy and have an oily film appearance, and they always float.  The color appears normal though. I am never able to clear my bowel at one go. Stool culture reports acidic stool with no other problems. I feel too gassy.
Although I do not have any abdominal pain, I do have a discomfort on the lower left side. I tried homeopathic, ayurvedic and allopathic medications. But something seems wrong
My USG is normal, with the most recent one showing distended gall bladder without wall thickening, but there is a tiny calcification on the right hepatic lobe.
Also, I have been diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism Hashimotos disease, which after two months of treatment is under control. Apart from that I have got vitamin D and vitamin B12. In spite of these issues, I have not lost weight.
In fact, I have gained a lot of weight, about 44 lbs in the last seven years, and now stable at 165 lbs.  I have taken probiotics and Rifaximin course thrice with no success.
I have also tried Nizonide, three-day course. Initially, I got well-formed stools, but when the doctor prescribed it for the second time , I found no improvement. I do not know what it is, but I feels it is slowly killing me.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Your reports look fine, except for the vitamin deficiencies.
When the work up is not guiding us to a particular direction, then we should consider a functional disorder like irritable bowel syndrome.
In IBS, there is constipation with discomfort. In such a situation, we first carry out a bowel dis-impaction, then continue on maintenance laxatives with lifestyle modifications. In my opinion, you do not require any further investigations.
I suggest the following measures
On the first day, take one packet of Peglec powder a combination of polyethylene glycol and electrolytes, dissolved in two liters of water over four hours, and repeat if watery stool does not pass.
On the next day, start Laxopeg polyethylene glycol, once in the morning and once at night.
Sit on the toilet two to three times a day for 15 minutes without straining, after intake of 500 ml water.
Consume a high fiber diet in the form of salads.
Avoid foods made with refined flour.
Ensure adequate water intake, about 4 to 5 liter a day.
Exercise regularly.
Alleviate mental stress, if any.

Your history is strongly in favor of tinea corporis. Tinea Corporis is a fungal infection, usually a consequence of excessive sweating, occlusion, and friction. If not treated correctly, it tends to keep recurring. Candid B is a combination of an antifungal with steroid and such combinations have recently been banned too. The steroid in the composition tends to only suppress but not cure the infection. In addition, it adds to the resistance, hence further delaying the response when treated correctly. Kindly upload appropriate images to confirm the diagnosis, stop Candid B immediately, let us know all the sites which are affected groins, axilla, etc. and mention if you are a diabetic.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 97, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

My condition is still unknown to me. However, two months ago, something blocked my ear, causing my hearing to suffer. Both my ears are always itchy. But that only lasts two weeks before my hearing returns to normal. This week it happened to me again, although in a different case. Something is blocking my eardrum again. I tried to clean it with the earpick, but I got some white ones. I got three large ones, and my hearing was normal again after I removed them.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern. First, I want to tell you never to again clean your ear yourself with Q tips, buds, or anything else. The ear has a natural cleaning mechanism called the migratory epithelial pattern, which gets disturbed when you put Q tips or anything like that inside the ear, leading to build-up and impaction of debris and wax. Your hearing is perfectly normal after the cleanup happy to know that, but please do not clean your ears yourself again. In the picture you sent the attachments are removed to protect the patients identity, the debris looks like infected epithelial pearl debris. So you need to send me a picture of the otoscopy to know the status of the tympanic membrane because this type of debris usually builds up in the ear when the tympanic membrane is retracted or there is inflammation in the tympanic membrane, called myringitis. I hope you find it helpful.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I am sorry to learn about your condition, and I am glad you are getting good treatment. I wish you all the strength you need to lead an everyday life despite your MS multiple sclerosis. As to your question Masturbation does not affect your MS whatsoever. Of course, compulsive masturbation, especially combined with prone, can cause hyper-arousal states that can be a problem in a marriage. But at the age of 16, moderate masturbation is not a problem. Also, not when we consider your MS. So feel free to release your tension sometimes. Please stay strong.

"Hi doctor,
I took Risperidone 3 mg daily for 11 months. Can it cause breast cancer? Also, I took ayurveda medicine for irregular periods. When I developed loss of appetite and nausea I stopped it. I took it only for one and a half month. I did not inform my psychiatrist about this. Please help.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Risperidone can cause a condition known as hyperprolactinemia or an increase in serum prolactin levels. This is associated with a number of symptoms, including secretion of milk from the breast, stoppage of periods, etc.
The increased risk of cancer is something that you should not worry about at all. Just as there are reports of increased risk, there are also reports of decreased risk.
In fact, Risperidone has also been used to treat breast cancer. This is under academic discussion and the current consensus is that there is no definitive evidence to support the statement that Risperidone causes cancer. So, do not worry about it.
In any case, since you have stopped taking it now, it will not affect you.
Regarding ayurveda medicine too, since you have stopped taking it, there is nothing to worry. If you have any persisting symptoms now, then we can look into it.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 93, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,
I recently had a blood test to check for markers of PCOS. The doctor told me that the blood test came back normal, no action was required, except for something to do with my antigens, and I was scheduled for a subsequent appointment. However, when I googled about abnormal antigens in blood, I found information related to cancer and tumors. I need peace of mind or any kind of understanding about this situation. Please help.
Thank you in advance.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have read your query, and understand your concern.
I understand that receiving ambiguous information from your doctor can be concerning and lead to anxiety. However, it is important not to jump to conclusions based on internet searches, as there can be various reasons for abnormal antigen levels in the blood, not just related to cancer and tumors. Antigens are substances that stimulate the bodys immune system to produce antibodies. There are many different types of antigens, and their levels can be affected by various factors. While some abnormal antigen levels may be associated with serious conditions, it is also possible for them to be related to minor or easily treatable issues. It is also essential to try to stay calm and patient until you have the opportunity to discuss the results with your doctor. Stress and anxiety can exacerbate health-related concerns, so take care of yourself during this waiting period. Remember that PCOS Polycystic Ovary Syndrome is a complex condition, and a diagnosis is typically made based on a combination of clinical symptoms, blood tests, and imaging studies like ultrasounds.
I read your query and understand your concern.

"Hi doctor,
My mom is suffering from sciatica pain. She is 45 years old. Her doctor suggested complete bed rest for two months. It has been a month for now. She is facing trouble to take breath properly night times. She is having head spinning and a sensation of falling from bed. She is having high blood pressure and is a diabetis patient. She is on regular tablets. What to do for the head spinning while sleeping on bed?","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
The possibilities for her head spinning are as follows.
Probably, your mom is suffering from benign paroxysmal positional vertigo BPPV. It can be controlled by a tablet like Vertin16 mg Betahistine or Stugeron Cinnarizine at bedtime or twice daily.
The second possibility is as she is diabetic and hypertensive, we have to think about circulation deficiency to the brainstem, which controls balance. It can be evaluated by doing MRI brain and adding Ecosprin to improve circulation to the brain.
It may also be drug induced. If she is taking Gabapentin or Pregabalin for neuropathic pain, then it may cause giddiness and sway while walking.
It can also be due to hypotension secondary to the hypertensive at night.
Vitamin B12 deficiency also can produce swaying and giddiness. You can confirm it by asking about peripheral numbness and increase in giddiness on standing with closed eyes. It can be corrected by vitamin B12 supplementation.
Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and ask to add Vertin or Stugeron. See the response. If your mom is not improving, then think about other possibilities.

"Hello doctor,I am a 26-year-old male. I have been diagnosed with lupus. However, I am questioning the diagnosis. Initial presentation of ITP platelet count under 10k minor loss of kidney function. Underwent biopsy and reported to have glomerulonephritis prominent mesangial deposits. In addition, three false syphilis positives. Failed hospital treatments IVIG, Dexamethasone, and Rituxan and underwent splenectomy. I had a heart attack Troponin 60, positive thyroperoxidase antibody, multiple years of positive lupus anticoagulant, positive beta-2 glycoprotein IgG and IgM, and positive anticardiolipin IgG, IgM, and IgA. I have never been positive about the Rh factor. My C4 complement is borderline low, and sometimes low C3 as well. Current stage 4 CKD BUN40, creatinine-3.04, GFR18. According to my doctors, the literature indicates SLE. However, given the newest criteria for a diagnosis provided by the NIH, due to the lack of positive ANA, I do not fit the category. Having read on the internet, glomerulonephritis, and thyroid disease, would produce the same symptoms. Given the above information, hypothetically, what further information would disprove an SLE diagnosis from a physicians perspective? Or is a coexistence of these factors likely? I quit frequent hookah smoking after a heart attack and no alcohol habit. Sometimes I have a fever, musclenerve pain, fatigue, alopecia, nausea, abdominal pain, brain fog, and weight gain. I am currently on Carvedilol, Eliquis, Acetaminophen, Clonidine, Hydralazine, Hydroxychloroquine, Azathioprine, Atorvastatin, and Aspirin. I understand that the information given does not imply treatment. Having read how many autoimmune diseases have overlapping symptoms, I am looking for a professional opinion.","Hello,Welcome to icliniq.com.Is your concern that it is SLE or not SLE only? The treatment is more important. It is an autoimmune process that has affected different organ systems. According to me, the concern should be how to halt the progress of the illness, for which knowing if it is purely SLE or not is more of a prognostic implication rather than therapeutic. Thyroid antibodies can be positive with any autoimmune process. Even there could be an underlying vasculitis and CKD, which could have led to the hearts involvement as well. According to me, what is more important is to focus on symptoms. Are you symptomatic? What is the inflammation score in terms of CRP, ESR, and complement levels, and if high, take immunosuppressants and steroids? Take care of the kidney status. Check a thyroid function test if it is deranged and then move to a deeper level of healing with a more disciplined approach, integrating meditation, diet, a physical routine, and mindfulness.

The HIV test uses a finger prick blood sample, with results given within 20 minutes, and is 99  accurate at detecting any HIV exposure that may have occurred more than 12 weeks ago.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern.
Fungal infection indeed is very problematic if it becomes recurrent. I suggest you keep the following precautions in mind
Do not keep the area wet at all. Use powder frequently to keep it dry.
Avoid itching and do not scratch it.
Change the undergarments.
Do not apply general or steroid creams like Betnovate Betamethasone etc.
Do not stop the medicine once it gets cured. Continue the medicine for a long time to completely get rid of the fungal infection.
Avoid excessive sweating and wet clothes.
Check your diabetes and thyroid levels as these are really recurrent even after proper treatment.
The treatment part is as follows
Apply Ketoconazole cream and take the tablet Terbinafine 250 mg for two months or apply Terbinafine cream.
Take the tablet Fluconazole 150 mg twice a week for two months or take the tablet Itraconazole 200 mg once a day and apply cream for one month.
Take a tablet of Levocetirizine 10 mg once at night in case of itching.
These are the  treatment combinations that you need to continue.

Sometimes there are few problems when medicines are started but they usually go spontaneously within 2 to 3 days. Medicine dosage can also be adjusted accordingly.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Dear patient, chronic sinusitis with deviated nasal septum is an indication for surgery. As mentioned by you, the nasal drops have been prescribed with antibiotics. I believe it must be decongestant nasal drops that are usually prescribed. If so, please make sure you do not use them for more than three days, or else after a while, the nasal mucosa stops responding rhinitis medicamentosa. I would prefer and suggest regular saline nasal drops for my patients that can be used multiple times and it does not create any issues. Secondly, there is a way to put nasal drops in the nose. The drops will act on the sides walls of your nose and not in the throat. So immediately after putting the drops, dab the nose, and this will prevent the drops from going down your throat. Thirdly, I would suggest you get a consultation and imaging done for your sinuses. For temporary relief, you can use steam inhalation after nasal drops and Vitamin C.

Welcome to icliniq.com.

Having the same blood group eliminates concerns regarding blood group compatibility for your future child. ABO and Rh are two different blood group systems commonly used. If your wife has a negative blood group Rh negative, she may require an anti-D injection during delivery to prevent complications. However, since both of you have the same blood group, there is no need to worry about Rh compatibility.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I went through your husbands history provided by you. By PE I assume you are referring to pulmonary embolism and not pericardial effusion. Are the tubes still present? If so the tube rubbing the pleura while taking a deep breath can cause the pain. Pulmonary embolism which may have cut off blood supply to part of the lung can cause the pain. If the tubes have been removed, the holes will heal in a couple of weeks. That will not cause the pain. In the case of pleural effusions, when they heal, it can cause some thickening of the outer layer of pleura which will limit the expansion of the lungs to some extent. This thickening can cause some pain and discomfort on deep breaths. This may persist for some time. In majority, this pain diminishes over time.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 80, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}"

"Hello doctor,
My baby is 4 weeks old. I fed her a combination of breast milk and formula milk. I changed her formula to Enfalac from Friscolac slowly, and started solely on Enfalac yesterday afternoon. I changed the milk upon consulting with the pediatric clinic because she was having constipation and gassy stomach. My baby had watery stool once yesterday and today only after being completely on Enfalac. She also is quite gassy most days and gets upset with it cries last about 10 minutes. My worry is that if she is okay and, does the Enfalac formula milk agree with her or she struggling with something else. I had to add formula milk due to insufficient supply of breast milk.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Breast milk is definitely best and first choice but as it is  insufficient and you need to supplement with formula feeds,  all these formula milk are cows milk. It is not clear from your query- which Enfalac formula you are giving as there are so many different types and also in the powder form and in ready to feed one. Watch it with the same formula milk for next 24 hours, feed more on breast feeding, and keep a watch on urine output.  It may settle down slowly. If not then get, stool test   - routine analysis, give Pedialyte 15- 20 ml after each loose motion give as small small sips, and better to give a milk formula which is HA hypoallergic like Similac or Nan or any other.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

"Hi doctor,My wife is 23 years old. She is 22 weeks pregnant. She has a previous history of complete CHB - congenital heart block diagnosed at the 20th week of her first pregnancy and it was terminated. In her present pregnancy, two weeks back, that is around the 20th week, the cardiologist did a fetal echo and told her everything was fine. But he said that there are some holes, and they will close automatically after birth. I need some valuable information about my baby. What are they and how it will close automatically? What does septal defect intact mean? Is there any suggestible medication? Both cardiologists and obstetricians said that babies will have holes while in the uterus, and they will close after birth. Is that true? Please advise and tell me the actual facts. I heard that some holes will not close and need surgery.Since her third month, my wife has been taking Wysolone 5 mg, one tablet in the morning and a half tablet in the evening. Also, HCQ 200 is administered once daily at night for precaution against CHB. Recently, Wysolone 5 mg dosage was changed to one tablet daily. She is also on Sandocal daily, two tablets, Livogen, Folvite, and Ecosprin 75 daily. She had Progesterone SR 200 mg daily twice from her second month to 21 weeks and stopped. I am providing a fetal echo report for reference.Thank you.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Thank you for sharing your wifes history, diagnosis, and pertinent reports attachment removed to protect patient identity.
First of all, your baby has a normal heart and has no heart problems.
All fetuses when inside the womb of the mother, they are required to have a small hole in between the top two chambers of the heart. This is called foramen ovale. I call this as a normal hole all fetuses have and after the fetus gets delivered, this normal hole spontaneously closes.
In some babies, it might take just a few hours, and in some babies a few days for this to close. So, your baby has a similar normal hole in between the top two chambers of the heart and is a small one. It will close by itself after the baby gets delivered.
The ventricular septum is the wall that separates the two bottom pumping chambers of the heart. There is no hole in this wall in a normal heart. In your babys fetal echo, they mentioned that this wall is intact, meaning that they did not see any problem causing a hole. This is good news.
Because your wife has an inflammatory, connective tissue disease called SLE systemic lupus erythematosus, there will be antibodies in her that can pass to the baby and react with the babys heart especially the electrical cells of the heart. Hence, the previous baby had a congenital heart block.
There are chances for this to reoccur in future pregnancies. Hence, some medications suppress this inflammation. Your wife is appropriately being placed on such anti-inflammatory medicines namely Wysolone Prednisolone and HCQ 200 Hydroxychloroquine.
The good news for now is that there is no problem with the babys heart rate and there is no evidence of heart block in the fetal echo. But, she needs to be constantly monitored for the babys heart rate as the problem can happen later also.
Your baby has just a normal hole and will close spontaneously after delivery. There is no problem with holes in the heart as per the echo report and hence, no surgical intervention is needed.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 95, 'clinical_accuracy': 19, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}"
"Hello doctor,
My father is 80 years old. He has diabetes for the past 30 years and hypertensive for the past five years. Has had a bypass before six years and also had a stroke before 14 years.
For the past two days, he had shooting pain in his right foot, so we consulted a podiatrist. He changed his medicine from Maxgalin 75 mg to Maxgalin NT. My father is already feeling better. He also ordered an arterial Doppler. Based on this, he has started him on Cilostazol 50 mg once in the morning for 15 days and then review. He is already taking Ecosprin 75 mg once in the morning and also Arreno twice a day. My fathers platelets usually remain close to 150000.
Is it acceptable to take so many thinners, and please review if it can interact with any of his other drugs or have any effect on the heart or brain? Is it safe to take Cilostazol with Pan D or Pan 40? Also, please review his Doppler.
He is now taking Mixtard Insulin 3070 - 50 units in the morning,13 units in the night, Glycomet GP2 1-0-1, and Linagliptin 5 mg 1-0-0.

He is on blood thinner, drug for peripheral vascular disease, prostate problems, and drug for neuropathic pain.
Among provided list Cilostazol which has been prescribed based on colour Doppler and can interact with Aspirin. However still, these two can be prescribed if necessary.
Arreno also contains Aspirin. So you can stop Aspirin either in Arreno or 75 mg Ecosprin. There is no need to take both Arreno and Ecosprin. You can discuss it with your doctor.
If you have any bleeding or blood in stool symptom, contact your doctor. Pantoprazole can be prescribed if gastritis develops with all these drugs.

Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have read your query and can understand your concern.
Your histopathology report indicates a superficial type of basal cell carcinoma. This is a common form of skin cancer, often seen in older individuals, potentially due to chronic sun exposure or previous injuries, although not exclusively. It does not spread to other organs and may sometimes result in bleeding or ulceration. The recommended treatment is excision with a margin of 0.12 to 0.2 inches three to five mm of surrounding healthy skin. Long-term follow-up is essential to monitor for any potential recurrence. Alternative treatment options may include cryotherapy, topical Imiquimod, or shave excision.
I hope this helps.

"Hi doctor,
I have been suffering from depression and anxiety since 10 years. I went to a psychiatrist and he prescribed too many medicines, which made matters worse. My family doctor has put me on Mirtaz 7.5 and due to severe problems of falling asleep I am on Zolfresh 10. My depression is a little better as it has been 15 days, but still I am not being able to fall asleep. We have tried having the medicine earlier in the night so I sleep on time, but it does not help. I face erections problems too. Kindly suggest a medicine that works well with Mirtaz for falling asleep.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
A number of issues need to be addressed here. Before we talk about medicines, it is important to give much attention to sleep hygiene as your medications. Regarding the medicines, Zolfresh Zolpidem is a medicine that has a short duration of action and starts working immediately. A key condition for Zolfresh to work well is that you lie down soon after you take it. In other words, you should take it no earlier than 5 to 10 minutes before your sleeping time. On the contrary, Mirtaz Mirtazapine acts after a time lag and has a relatively long duration of action. So, you need to take it a good two to three hours before your sleeping time. So, if all the above aspects have been taken care of, the next step would be to increase the dose of Mirtazapine. You are currently on the least available dose of Mirtazapine. You can try increasing it to 15 or 30. Remember that the maximum dose of Mirtaz is 60 mg per day. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and get the dose altered. Your daytime sleepiness may be related to two things inadequate sleep at night, and continuing effects of Mirtazapine into the day. Since you are having problems with sleeping at night, I would assume that predominantly it is the scenario one. I would suggest you stop Armod Armodafinil 150 for the time being and get your sleep back on track with these measures. Pay special attention to the sleep hygiene points. You will also need to get a serum TSH and hemogram done. As far as erectile difficulties are concerned, with the above measures some improvement is expected because psychological well being is closely related to erectile function. Once the sleep and depression issues are sorted out and the erectile problem still persists, then we can look into it.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have gone through your case, and I understand your concern.
The normal menstrual cycle ranges from 21 to 35 days, and PCOS polycystic ovary syndrome is very common, especially in the young population. Menstrual irregularities, acne and excessive weight gain are commonly seen in PCOS. Also, irregular menses and intermenstrual spotting could be seen in thyroid disorders. So it would be best to rule out that before going towards any treatment. I suggest you get the USGultrasonogram pelvis scan, thyroid profile, and CBC complete blood count.

Stop worrying so much. According, to the information provided by you. You had your first period on 7th May and second on 13 June and third on 30th July. You were sexually active on 16 May and not after that. You did your last UPT on 23rd July. According to this information, you cannot be pregnant. Let me tell you some facts. Post-abortion, you can have irregular periods. UPT usually becomes positive on the first day of the missed period or within 14 days of intercourse, if you would have conceived then the test you did on 12 June would have  come positive. If this would have been implantation bleeding, then UPT would have come positive by now. You had your last intercourse on 16th May even after two months of intercourse your pregnancy test was negative, then why are you thinking of implantation bleeding. So much of stress will definitely make your cycles irregular.

Do not be scared. Repeat the tests soon. A raised B12 can happen due to laboratory error. Even after that, if you have SGOT aspartate transaminase above SGPT alanine transaminase, you should do a USG ultrasound abdomen. A raised SGOT above SGPT of about 21 ratio suggests an alcoholic liver disease. I do not know about your drinking habits.
A chronically elevated SGOT above SGPT can also occur due to nonhepatic causes like hypothyroidism and in some myopathies muscle illness. You should get your tests repeated along with serum TSH levels, complete blood count and kidney function tests.

If you have diffuse otitis externa then you must rule out malignant otitis externa. If you are immunocompromised or a diabetic you need to worry about the same. It will be prudent to get a culture sensitivity swab of the discharge from the ear whenever you have the condition. A permanent solution would require you to avoid water entry into the ears. Anti-inflammatory medicines like Trypsin-Chymotrypsin will be contributory to remove the edema and swelling inside. Appropriate antibiotic drops will lessen the bacterial flora. Acetic acid drops are available which restore the pH inside the ear canal and prevent bacterial growth. An otoscopic examination can rule out otomycosis which requires anti-fungal drops.

"Hello doctor,

I informed the doctor I had pain in the area, but I did not have any acute pain. I just wanted to get it sorted out because I have huge anxiety in general, especially when it comes to health, so he packed it with some eugenol paste that day. It is currently three days after the appointment, and the filling has come loose and moves when I lift my tongue. Did I have a dry socket in the first place, and if not, can I get it now? I have had no pain apart from one day after the extraction, which was insignificant and lasted for two minutes. Kindly advise.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Usually, after the extraction of a wisdom tooth, swelling, pain, and difficulty in opening the mouth are common. Healing depends upon the extraction procedure too, so if you are a smoker or have any habits, it can alter the healing process. Any activities like pulling with the tongue or forceful spitting can also cause dislodgement of the clot hence healing is affected. So if a eugenol pack is placed and induces bleeding, it will reduce your symptoms and promote healing. I think you do not need to worry about dry socket as your pain has decreased. In a dry socket, unbearable pain would be there, and bone also may be exposed. So you do not need to worry. Stay calm and relaxed because that is also necessary. Clean the area with saline rinses after each meal. Maintain oral hygiene. Please follow up after three days with your dentist and update me about the symptoms after two days.

"Hello doctor,
I am presently in the first year of my college. When I was studying in school three years ago, I was overweight, and I started to exercise and diet. I managed to lose 20 kg, and I was in shape. But after two years, I had dengue and did not do the proper treatment as my brother had a severe injury, and my parents could not give me more attention. At that point, I stopped taking care of myself and gained so much weight that I am 103 kg right now. In the past two years, I have had many problems.

From then, after gaining weight, I have never sent him a full body picture, as I was afraid that he will know that I have gained a lot of weight. Our relationship is going really nice, but now as he posts more pictures, he does not allow me to post any of my pictures on social media or anywhere. Now he is getting more followers, and it is making me feel more insecure and needy. Not only this, this year I lost my uncle, and he was murdered by someone two months ago, which is creating lots of family pressure. Now I am going for bariatric surgery. I sometimes feel positive as I see my life and future, but it is taking a lot of time, and all negative thoughts are coming into my mind. I am feeling insecure and alone. I am also not able to go to college for a month, and my studies are lagging behind. I want to do many things, but I am not trying. Please help me if you can.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I thoroughly read your query and understand your concern.
Due to ongoing stress, you gained weight again, and this is causing you to feel bad. Due to these thoughts, you are feeling insecure. This is the reason for mild depression. Since you are in a relationship for quite a long time, you can tell your boyfriend that you have gained some weight but, this issue will be resolved in some time. This will reduce the guilt in your mind and also reduce insecurity. It will help in making your mood better, and you will be able to think positively. Bariatric surgeries help in losing weight, and once the excess fat is removed, then you can focus on exercise and dietary management, and you will be in fit condition again. There is nothing to feel bad about this. Even if you are overweight, that is not a thing to feel stigmatized.
Hope this has addressed your concern.
Thanks and regards.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hi doctor,
I had oral sex, and my partner ejaculated his sperms inside my mouth, and I sipped the sperm that came out. After that he touched his penis, then he grabbed my pants near my vagina twice. After that, he used the same fingers inside my vagina. It was my first time with the oral sex and fingering. I do not know that there were sperms in his hand. We did not have sex. But, can I get pregnant in this situation? I missed my periods this month. What is the cause?","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
In your case, there is a chance that semen might have entered into the vagina. As you have not done any sexual intercourse, there is less chance of getting pregnant. You have to rule out pregnancy by urine hCG human chorionic gonadotropin test. You can do this test at home. If pregnancy is not present, then thyroid problem and diabetes should be ruled out. Excess stress, obesity, prolonged fasting can also lead to a delayed period. You can consult a gynecologist for examination if needed.","{'score': 88, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 5, 'transparency': 8}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 88, 'clinical_accuracy': 19, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 9}"
"Hello doctor,
I have depression. But for some reason, I do not want to take antidepressants. I have been taking it for the past one year. And have stopped it. But sometimes I get very depressed. Can I take my antidepressant like Desvenlafaxine sometimes? As needed? Or maybe any other antidepressant which I can take a couple of times and then be antidepressants free?","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
You have not mentioned the severity of your depression. If you have the first episode of depression. and you were stable on medication for more than six months then you can try to stop the medication. But if you have again depression then you need to take medication. You also try to manage your depression by non-pharmacology management. like, take daily 7 to 8 hours of sound sleep, avoid junk food and eat healthy home cooked food, avoid cold drinks and any types of alcohol or smoking or drugs. Do the daily exercise for 30 to 40 minutes like swimming, walking, etc. Do daily meditation for 10 to 15 minutes, eat fruits and vegetables, lose your weight. Try to take a daily cold shower in mornings, spend time on good hobbies like reading books, write a diary, painting, etc. Be active in your life, do not just spend life, live your life. Be confident and bold, spend quality time with family and close friends, avoid staying alone. Do the investigations like CBC, TSH thyroid stimulating hormone, vitamin B12, these abnormalities may lead you to depression. And your weight is really 90 kg, then you must have to lose your weight. It will help you to deal with your depression. But you need to take medication if still, you have depression.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 94, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 9, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,
I have a stomach ulcer that is not caused by H. pylori, and it is not an NSAID ulcer as well. What can I do to completely get rid of this ulcer? I am taking Ranitidine for it. The ulcer has come and gone over the past two years roughly. The stomach ulcer was diagnosed by asking a series of questions and by touching my stomach area. I have anxiety and depression, so stress is likely the main cause, according to my physician, and I smoke marijuana. My current medication includes Ranitidine, Trintellix, Clonazepam, Tricera birth control, and Zopiclone. I am also taking multivitamins and probiotics, which are self-prescribed.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
First of all, from your history, it is not proven that you have an ulcer. It may just be underlying gastritis.
I suggest you-
1. You must avoid the precipitating factors like spicy, fried food, alcohol, marijuana, etc.
2. You must lead a stress-free life.
3. You mjust get an endoscopy done and revert with the endoscopy report.
The medicines like Ranitidine can be used for two to three days when you have severe symptoms. Avoid daily or prolonged use.

"Hello doctor,
The current symptoms consist of distressing nerve pain and muscle tightness. The pain feels nervy and ranges from sharp to dull ache. It is present below my sternum and branches to both left and right sides of my chest, though it is much worse on the left, in the area surrounding my heart. It proceeds down from my sternum to the solar plexus, middle of my abdomen, and ends at the bottom, a few inches below my navel. It also wraps around my ribcage on either side and into my back, especially below the shoulder blades. The muscle tightness affects the entire torso, though the worst areas are the intercostal muscles in the front, sides, and back of my ribs and the front of my abdomen, including what feels like my diaphragm. This can cause my breathing to be difficult, and I often feel like I am not getting enough air. There has been no recent injury, and I was diagnosed with medication-related akathisia four months ago. Currently, I am taking Neurontin, Clonazepam, Propranolol, Benadryl all for akathisia symptoms.","Hello,

I can understand your concern. The symptoms may well be neurogenic nerve origin as it radiates down the chest and involves the abdomen. Also, gastroesophageal stomach and food pipe causes may be ruled out by appropriate investigations upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.

"Hi doctor,
For years I have suffered from ALS and Alzheimer-like symptoms until I was able to figure out that eating anything with D-Glutamate was the cause the natural version L-Glutamate does not bring on the symptoms. My symptoms include muscle weakness, muscle spasms, increased heart rate, lockjaw, brain fog, confusion, memory issues, muscle tightness leading to partial diaphragm paralysis, and sphincter of Oddi disorder. Symptoms subside if I eat only whole plain foods with no MSG or glutamate. Muscle weakness thigh muscles when walking up stairs and brain fog started about 15 years ago and increasingly worsened from then on. I tested negative for multiple sclerosis and myasthenia gravis. The blood work was good. I did not have my DNA tested and it flagged a higher chance of inheriting Alzheimers. My father was diagnosed with Parkinsons in his early 80s. Currently, I am not on any medication. I do not smoke or drink. I do not drink coffee. If I do accidentally eat something with glutamate, the herb Valerian has helped reduce the reaction.
I have read many medical papers on this and a lot of them are connecting a reaction to glutamate to neurological disorders. Does this mean I might have a neurological disorder as an underlying cause?

It is very difficult to give you a diagnosis by reading your description.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I read your query and can understand your concern.
Based on your reported symptoms and lab results, you may be experiencing anemia. Anemia is a condition that occurs when your body does not have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen to your tissues. This can cause symptoms such as fatigue, low energy, irregular heartbeat, and shortness of breath. Your lab results indicate low hemoglobin, hematocrit, ferritin, and vitamin D3 values. These are all indicators of anemia. Additionally, your low vitamin B12 level could contribute to the feeling of fatigue that you are experiencing. Treatment may include dietary changes, iron supplements, and vitamin supplements. In the meantime, prioritizing self-care is essential by getting enough rest, eating a balanced diet, and staying hydrated. This can support your overall health and also help to alleviate some of your symptoms. Take care.

"Hello doctor,I am a 23-year-old male, and I have been dealing with premature ejaculation issues. I used to masturbate excessively in the past, but I have managed to gain better control over it now. I can delay my ejaculation for about 2 to 3 minutes. Given my situation, I am considering trying herbal supplements like Shilajit Gold or Herbo 24 Turbo. I am currently unmarried, and I am also curious about any potential herbal remedies. Can you provide some guidance on which option might be the best for me in addressing this concern?Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I read your query.
I understand your concerns regarding premature ejaculation, and it is essential to explore the underlying factors contributing to this issue. Several potential reasons for premature ejaculation include
Stress and work High-stress levels or demanding work schedules, such as night shifts, can impact your sexual performance.
Medical conditions Conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and thyroid problems can influence premature ejaculation. Managing these conditions and keeping your blood sugar, blood pressure, and thyroid hormones in check is crucial.
Medications Some medications, especially those for hypertension or psychiatric conditions, may affect ejaculation.
Masturbation and porn Frequent masturbation or excessive exposure to pornography can contribute to premature ejaculation.
Lack of knowledge Insufficient foreplay or a lack of understanding of foreplay and female masturbation can play a role.
Guilt Engaging in extramarital affairs may lead to feelings of guilt that affect sexual performance.
Physical health Lack of exercise and obesity can also be contributing factors.
To address your concerns, I recommend the following steps
Medical checkup Consult a healthcare professional to assess your health. Check your fasting blood sugar FBS, postprandial blood sugar PPBS, blood pressure BP, and thyroid function Free T3, Free T4, TSH to rule out any underlying medical issues.
Temporary solution I would suggest you consider using a medication like Duralast Dapoxetine 30mg as a temporary solution to help delay ejaculation.
Natural methods Implement natural methods to improve sexual performance. Focus on extending foreplay, with women receiving 15 to 20 minutes and men 10 to 15 minutes of foreplay for optimal blood flow to the penis. Relaxation techniques, such as soothing music, can help. You can also try delay condoms.
Emotional connection Remember that sex is not a race, and duration alone does not determine satisfaction. Develop a deeper emotional connection with your partner, learn about female pleasure, and prioritize your partners satisfaction.
It is important to approach this issue with patience and open communication with your partner. If the problem persists, consider consulting a sex therapist or counselor for further guidance and support.

"Hello doctor,
I have had gastritis and IBS-D for the past three months. Also, I have grade 1 fatty liver, sinus tachycardia, and an enlarged prostate. Currently, I am taking tablet Propranol 10 mg twice daily, capsule Famotidine 20 mg twice daily, capsule Vitamin D 60000 IU, and capsule Vitamin A to Z. I have undergone endoscopy for erosive gastritis, CT scan of the abdomen, and ultrasound scan.
My query is about using the right multivitamin. My vitamin and mineral levels are in ngml - A-716, E-20939.1, K-0.72, B1-1.43, B2-37.31, B3-0.58, B5-137.84, B6-30.17, B7-0.44, B9-0.79, B12-226, copper-125.65 ugdL, magnesium-2.26 mgdL, zinc-202.54 ugdL, selenium-120.59 ugdL, manganese-13.51 ugdL. My vitamin E levels are also higher than the normal range. Can you please suggest a suitable multivitamin for me?
Kindly advise.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have read your query and also seen the test results that you have attached attachments removed to protect the patients identity. Your vitamin B panel test values are within the normal limits. Vitamin B1, B3, B9, and B12 values are in the lower half of the reference range. Most people get enough B vitamins through their diet. For deficiency of a particular vitamin, supplements can be given in the form of capsules to restore the vitamin level. I suggest you to use capsule Becosules vitamin B complex and vitamin C once a day for one month and take a healthy, nutritional diet to maintain normal vitamin levels in the body. Vitamin B12 is found only in foods of animal origin. A Vitamin B-rich diet includes green leafy vegetables, milk, and dairy products like yogurt, cheese, non-vegetarian foods like fish and red meat, whole grains, cereals, nuts, and fruits. A diet rich in vitamin B will help maintain an adequate level without the need for supplements.
Also, I have gone through the laboratory results that you have attached. All laboratory parameters like diabetic status, kidney function tests, liver function tests, thyroid profile, minerals, and hormones are normal. High sensitivity C-reactive protein is just above 3 mgL. As you can read in the interpretation, HS-CRP, along with other risk factors of an acute coronary syndrome ACS, is an essential clinical laboratory parameter for the assessment. HS-CRP becomes important when other risk factors of ACS are present like diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, history of smoking, and family history. Your LDL low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is high and total cholesterol is just above the normal upper reference value. I suggest you control the intake of a fat-rich diet and do daily exercise to reduce the values I also suggest you consult a doctor who knows your past medical history and can give necessary suggestions to lower these values.
I hope this helps.
Kindly revert in case of further questions.

The cosmetic procedures to choose for the treatment of uneven pigmentation are PRP platelet-rich plasma with growth factors and collagen complex, glutathione shots, microneedling with serums, laser therapy, chemical peeling, vitamin shots. It is very important you follow a healthy skin routine for healthy skin. Start with cleansing your face with facewashes. Use soap-free cleansers like Cetaphil or CeraVe or D acne. Avoid foamy facewashes. If you have visible pores and you are prone to blackheads, you can use any alcohol-free toners after face wash. Next step you can use the serum. After serum, use a moisturizer, gel- based preferably again you can use Cetaphil, CeraVe, La Roche Posay, or any moisturizer with an Aloe vera or oatmeal, rice extracts for a soothing effect. It is very important to use a moisturizer to seal in the moisture. At daytime, use a sunscreen of SPF sun protection factor not less than 30, two hours before getting into the sun. Apply twice once in the morning and next application at noon. Drink a minimum of eight glasses of water. Maintain a healthy weight and diet.

"Hello doctor,
My wife is 13 weeks and 5 days pregnant at present. She vomits in the mornings, and she has continuous light stomach pain. Once or twice a day, she has intense stomach pain for 5 to 7 minutes. She takes Doxinate tablet once a day. Is this type of pain common in pregnancy? Can she take Doxinate throughout her pregnancy? Will Digene help in these type of stomach pain and is it safe during pregnancy?","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
How are you doing?
Usually, vomiting during pregnancy lasts till 12 to 16 weeks maximum. She can keep having Doxinate Doxylamine succinate and Pyridoxine hydrochloride, 2 to 4 times a day. It is safe in pregnancy.
Gelusil or Mucaine gel is safer and better alternative, and it is recommended during pregnancy. She can get more relief by trying the following
Avoid oily and spicy food.
Avoid lying flat after food.
Have a stroll for few minutes before sleeping.
Avoid lime or orange juice.
About the abdominal pain, I think, what you are mentioning is in the upper abdomen. This is due to gastritis or vomiting. It will resolve only after vomiting stops.
If the pain is in the lower abdomen, just rule out urinary infection by a routine urine test. Throughout pregnancy, the lady will have some discomfort or pain due to the stretching of the uterus. If the pain is unbearable, try injection Proluton-Depot Hydroxyprogesterone 500 mg. This hormone will relax her uterus and be effective for two weeks.
Hope I have clarified your query, and do write back. All the best.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have gone through your case in detail.
It is good that you took your daughter for blood tests which are essential to check if there is hemoglobin deficiency. First, try to improve her diet and encourage her to take milk and egg protein. Secondly, try to know if she is suffering from depression or stress or if it could be an effect of bullying as well. Children of this age are very much prone to such incidents, which manifests in severe hair loss. Being a dermatologist, I have noticed it in many youngsters. Regarding treatment, I suggest she apply a mix of Betamethasone lotion and Liquid Paraffin to the scalp two times a week and leave it overnight.
I hope this helps.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have seen the pictures attachment removed to protect patient identity.
This is a vocal nodule that is common in those who are involved in teaching or singing.
The initial treatment plan will be a trial of drugs for one or two weeks and if it is decreased, then it is not a problem. If it persists, then it should be removed with a small surgery.
The surgery is a small procedure and is not very painful.
After removing the lesion, it has to be tested for signs of cancerous cells. The treatment is based on further reports.

"Hi doctor,
I am a teenager of average build. I have had pimples and scars on my cheeks and forehead for two months.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern.
It could be acne vulgaris and post-acne hyperpigmentation PIH with atrophic scarring. Acne appears most frequently due to hormonal fluctuations, imbalances, genetic reasons, climate changes, food habits, consumption of oily, fried, and sweet foods, and as a reaction to new products used on the face. Acne can appear and disappear. Each time it does, it can be managed. Acne is accompanied by dark spots and pores, which result from acne inflammation and excessive oil secretion from the skin. There are medications and procedures available to help with this.
I suggest you use AHA glow S salicylic acid 2  and glycolic acid foaming face wash, massaged gently in circular motions, and washed off within one minute. Use twice daily. Apply Clinmiskin Clindamycin Niacinamide gel on the pimples twice daily. Take a tablet of Ascorbic acid vitamin C 500 mg chewable tablet twice daily after food. You can also apply Aziderm Azelaic Acid 10  cream to the affected area on alternate days at night. First, make sure your face is thoroughly cleansed and dried. Your hands and face should be completely dry and free of moisture. Then, apply a pea-sized amount of cream in a very thin layer only to the affected areas. Because the medication is strong and may cause irritation, do not use it all over the face or in large quantities. If the acne is mild, avoid using it. This treatment is only for severe acne. The medications listed above are for active acne and new acne management. They do not help with atrophic scarring, also known as depressed scarring. Some procedures are particularly effective in reducing the appearance of pregnancy-induced hypertension PIH and atrophic scarring. In severe cases, antibiotics are needed. In that case, you can take a capsule of Evion vitamin E 400 mg daily at night after food.
Avoid using skin care products because they can cause allergic reactions and breakouts depending on the ingredients. Scar removal procedures are the only way to manage pregnancy-induced hypertension PIH and acne scarring because medications have limitations, and procedures can penetrate the skin to help correct internal problems. Most scarring is caused by inflammatory reactions and habitual acne pricking, resulting in depressed scars that require surgical intervention. Laser therapy procedures can be done once a month to help with current acne, hyperpigmented spot fading, and atrophic scarring. However, they are performed monthly and may necessitate a direct consultation with a Dermatologist. Chemical peeling can be done once every two weeks to one month, and glycolic acid peels may be performed on your skin to manage existing acne, scarring, and dark spots. They cause mild peeling of the affected area and are performed in sessions, rejuvenating the skin and reducing the appearance of wrinkles. The medications may also be used in conjunction with it.
Continue to avoid oily, fried foods, as you have been doing, as well as milk and dairy products, sweets, and chocolates. They cause acne. Consume more fruits, vegetables, and fiber-rich foods, and drink at least ten glasses of water per day to stay hydrated. Acne can come and go depending on the factors mentioned above. They can, however, be managed with medications and procedures and by avoiding external triggers, as previously mentioned. Internal triggers, on the other hand, are determined by hormonal fluctuations that cannot be controlled but can be managed with the assistance of a Gynecologist. In addition, acne usually fades as people age, and their hormone levels normalize. Therefore, avoid picking at acne as much as possible. Please attach an image of the affected area for better assessment and evaluation.","{'score': 97, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"

I am a 24-year-old female. I visited a dentist a week back for pain and swelling at the back of the throat at the retromolar region. The dentist took an X-ray, but no wisdom tooth was present. The dentist prescribed antibiotic Metronidazole and I completed the course. The problem is my ulcer at the region does not heal. Is it normal that the ulcer does not go away?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have just gone through your complaint. It could be due to some vitamin deficiency since you have already taken Metronidazole, which has not helped you. So, it may not be a bacterial infection. I would suggest you use a mouthwash containing Chlorhexidine gluconate, undiluted. Swish it inside your mouth for 30 seconds and spit. Use it twice a day after meals. Do not eat or drink anything after that for half an hour. I would also suggest you take Vitamin B complex with Zinc, for example, Becosules Z, for 10 days after breakfast. You also need to use an oral gel containing Lidocaine and Chlorhexidine gluconate. Apply it on the affected area two to three times a day. Continue taking Mefenamic acid for pain. Since you developed this problem just a week back, it is something acute. Do not worry. Take warm and soft food for a week. I would like to know whether you smoke or not. I hope it helps you. If the problem persists, you can write to us or visit a dentist specializing in oral medicine and radiology.","{'score': 89, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 83, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 5, 'transparency': 8}","{'score': 71, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 8}"

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concern. As per the values mentioned by you, the hemoglobin level is low which indicates anemia. RDW-CV red cell distribution width-coefficient of variation is on the higher side attachment removed to protect patient identity. Its normal value should be up to 15 . A high RDW-CV favors iron deficiency anemia. But it can be seen in vitamin B12 and folate deficiency also.
Hematocrit is low. The normal value should be between 37 to 48  for women. All the three parameters are indicating towards iron deficiency anemia. Only MCHC is contradictory but in early stages, you can find normal or slightly high MCHC in iron deficiency anemia. To confirm it, I suggest you few blood tests like a peripheral smear, serum iron, total iron binding capacity, ferritin levels, serum B12, and folate. There are many causes of iron deficiency anemia like chronic blood loss from the gastrointestinal tract, menorrhagia, hookworm infestation, dietary deficiency, etc. In my opinion, you should consult a physician and get evaluated properly so that the cause of anemia could be found and proper treatment in the form of iron supplementation can be given.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

Thank you for the query. According to your statement, you have recently noticed a little discoloration near the nipple area of your left breast. I can understand your concern.

Welcome to icliniq.com. I can understand your feelings of detachment. From the available history, I think you are suffering from some type of dissociative disorder. I have considered your neurological checkup is normal. Your history suggests that you have depersonalization disorder which is marked by a feeling of detachment or distance from ones own experience, body or self. These feelings of depersonalization are recurrent. Of the dissociative disorders, depersonalization is the one most easily identified with by the general public one can easily relate to feeling as they in a dream, or being spaced out. An individual with depersonalization disorder has this experience so frequently and so severely that it interrupts his or her functioning and experience. A persons experience with depersonalization can be so severe that he or she believes the external world is unreal or distorted. If you feel you are in the same situation, discuss with your psychiatrist. It can be treated for sure and you can come out from this problem completely. Mostly dissociative disorders are triggered as a response to trauma or abuse. Treatment for individuals with such a disorder is psychotherapy mostly. However, a combination of psychopharmacological and psychosocial treatment is often used. Many of the symptoms of dissociative disorders occur with other disorders, such as anxiety and depression and can be controlled by same drugs used to treat those disorders. You might benefit from antidepressants or anti-anxiety medication.","{'score': 91, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"

Welcome to icliniq.com. I read your query and understand your concerns about an ongoing lower back ache. I have seen the reports that you had attached attachment removed to protect patient identity. There is a compression of the L4 nerve, which is responsible for the numbness and difficulty in sleeping.  In my opinion, you need to contact a physiotherapist without further delay. As it is a minor bulging, there is a good possibility that physiotherapy will help stop the progress of the disease. I also feel that it is the right time to straighten your back adequately. Since you have a sitting job, I feel that there must be enough involvement in either sports or exercise. The right exercise will help you in managing the symptoms. Even running or fast walking is a good option for exercise. Regarding analgesics, take them on a need basis. It is ideal to take Paracetamol as it is one of the safest options. In case paracetamol alone does not help you, Ibuprofen can be another option. I hope this helps you.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Thank you for giving us a lot of details which make our work easy. At this age, it seems to me that you got enlarged prostate hence weaker stream and on-off pain in testis. An enlarged prostate is mainly a male issue at the age of above 40 years. It can cause weaker stream, nocturia waking at night to pass urine, and swelling or inflammation of the epididymis or testis. Medical treatment can improve symptoms like taking Alfuzosin or better Tamsulosin 0.4 mg at night before bed. Therapy is for the long term as if stopped will cause symptoms again. You are also advised to do urine analysis and culture, serum PSA prostate-specific antigen tests, follow-up, and inform me about the progress.

It is most effective on solitary gallstones less than 6 centimeters in diameter, so fewer than 15 percent of patients are eligible for ESWL. The treatment aims to break up or fragment gallstones by sending shock waves through the bodys soft tissue.
Contact dissolution therapy involves injecting a solvent known as methyl tertiary-butyl ether MTBE into the gallbladder to dissolve the gallstones. Initial studies have shown that MTBE rapidly dissolves gallstones.
You can also try natural remedies like two teaspoons of apple cider vinegar and one teaspoon of lemon juice to a glass of warm water. Drink it on an empty stomach in the morning. Doing this regularly for weeks can dissolve gallstones and prevent pain.
I encourage you to incorporate these liver-cleanse foods into your weekly diet, like garlic, grapefruit, carrots, green tea, green leafy vegetables, avocados, apples, and olive oil.
Avoid foods that are fried, like french fries and potato chips high-fat meats, such as bacon, bologna, sausage, ground beef, and ribs high-fat dairy products, such as cheese, ice cream, cream, whole milk, and sour cream, pizza, foods made with lard or butter, creamy soups or sauces, meat gravies, chocolate.

"Hello doctor,
I am a 28-year-old male with a broken tooth on my left side. I could feel the broken tooth with my tongue. Recently, I woke up with severe pain in the right side of my jaw close to my ear. I am experiencing pain in the right side jaw when chewing, yawning, or opening my mouth.
It has been a month since the pain started. I get relief from pain when the jaw area is pressed with my finger. I am taking pain relief medications to cope with pain. I am consulting a dentist to fix the broken teeth on the left side. Could you suggest what caused the pain?
Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have read your query, and I can understand your concern.
When a tooth is near a nerve, it may induce pain. You can consider the following treatment
Do not open your mouth a lot.
Do not touch the left tooth with your tongue.
Keep your mouth relaxed.
Do not bite or grind teeth unnecessarily.
Massage your jaw from the outer side.
Use a warm cloth to soothe the jaws. Put a warm cloth near the painful part and keep it for a few minutes. Repeat it twice or thrice a day. You can use ice too, but a warm cloth will work better.
Ask the doctor to treat the tooth or extract it according to the condition of the tooth.
I hope this information is helpful.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I read your query and understand your concern.
There are many reasons for hair fall or thinning of hair on the scalp. First, we have to find the cause with the help of detailed history and examination. Some of the common causes are nutritional deficiency, hormonal causes like androgenic alopecia or pattern baldness, hypothyroidism, telogen effluvium, etc. Unless we find and treat the cause there is no point in giving non-specific treatment. Oils or shampoos do not have any effect on hair growth as they are not absorbed into the skin.

"Hi doctor,
I am asking questions on behalf of my son. Due to pandemics, we are not allowed to consult a dermatologist in person. But his skin has changed drastically. He is 16 years old and his face looks old. He has dark spots due to acne scarring and so he decided to use Ambi skincare fade cream. He thought it would make wonders on his face. But it caused red, darker, larger spots on the forehead, chin, and sides of the cheek. He left it for few days. After that, he decided to use some home remedies. He found that garlic will fight on dark spots and so he used it on the face. It caused a burning sensation on the face. On the next day, he had skin irritation. Now, his forehead has wrinkles. He also has some huge dark yellowish and brownish patches on the skin with acne. He has tried using some homemade recipes to lighten the face. But it has not worked. He tried to boost melanin and collagen. But there are no good results. Now he is using anti-wrinkle cream. He cannot see any good results and his skin is getting worse. I have told him to give some time for the skin. Kindly suggest.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Acne occurs commonly in teenagers. They appear and disappear with age. They occur due to sebum production from the oil glands present in the face. It blocks the oil tract present on the surface of the skin. It gets aggravated by oily cosmetics and bacteria. Treatment depends on the grade of acne. For mild ones, you can use simple creams and gels made of vitamin A derivative, and few antibiotics can be taken. In higher grades, you can take oral medication with topical ones. In severe grades, you can use oral vitamin A derivatives like Isotretinoin. It seems that your son has dark spots due to acne. Please mention whether he has pigmentation and scars. Try to protect the skin from sunlight. Your son can use sunscreen gel with SPF sun protection factor more than 30. He can use a cream containing alpha hydroxy acid with any acid. It must be used in low quantity. He can use Retinoic acid with AHA alpha hydroxy acid at bedtime. He can use Kojic acid and Glycolic acid combination cream at night.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,
I have observed changes in the color of my urine, and I suspect it may be linked to bilirubin. I am seeking personalized insights into the significance of bilirubin in urine, its correlation with jaundice, and any specific concerns or recommended actions based on my health situation. Kindly help.
Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I can understand your concern.
Bilirubin in Urine
Normally, bilirubin is absent in urine. The presence of bilirubin in urine, known as bilirubinuria, may indicate liver problems. Bilirubin, a yellow pigment from the breakdown of red blood cells, is typically processed by the liver and eliminated through bile, ultimately appearing in stool. Impaired liver function can lead to the accumulation of bilirubin in the bloodstream and its subsequent presence in urine, causing a dark or tea-colored appearance.
Jaundice
Jaundice is the yellowing of the skin and eyes resulting from elevated bilirubin levels in the blood. Various liver conditions, such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, and bile duct blockage, can cause jaundice. Bilirubinuria may precede visible jaundice, making early detection important.
Potential Concerns and Actions
Seek Immediate Medical Attention If you notice dark or tea-colored urine, along with symptoms like fatigue, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain, consult a healthcare professional promptly. These could indicate a serious underlying liver condition.
Avoid Self-Diagnosis Only a qualified healthcare provider can perform accurate tests and provide a diagnosis based on your individual health history and symptoms.
Prepare for Questions Expect your doctor to inquire about your medical history, medications, and potential risk factors for liver disease during the evaluation.
I hope this information will help you.

"Hi doctor,
I had vitamin B12 deficiency. My doctor advised me to have 10 injections. Now, my vitamin B12 is more than 2000. What should I do?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com. The treatment duration for B12 deficiency varies based on factors such as the underlying cause, severity of the deficiency, and presenting symptoms. In cases of vitamin B12 deficiency common among strict vegetarians, a typical treatment approach involves intramuscular injections of B12 daily for one week, followed by weekly injections for four weeks, and then transitioning to monthly injections every six months. If the cause of B12 deficiency is pernicious anemia, which involves impaired B12 absorption, the treatment course may extend for a longer duration. The duration of treatment is also influenced by specific signs and symptoms, such as low hemoglobin levels and neuropathy. For individuals with B12 deficiency and without a known cause, or those following a strict vegetarian diet, it is recommended to take B12 tablets containing 1 mg weekly for two days. Further details are necessary to provide tailored recommendations for a more effective management plan.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I fully understand your concern and will surely help you.
For getting pregnant, the sperms have to be released inside the vagina of the female. Then, these sperms need to fertilize an egg which may or may not be available depending upon the ovulation pattern of the female. The fertilized egg is then required to be implanted in the uterus of the female. Only when all these happen successfully, then a female is said to have conceived. In your case, since there was no penetration, there is significantly less chance of sperm fertilizing an egg. So, do not worry. To be in the safer zone, I suggest her do a home pregnancy test after five days.

I have seen your query and examined your picture attachment removed to protect patient identity. From your descriptions and given image, it does seem you have nevus spilus. There is nothing to worry about. The nevus spilus is present in 3  of fair-skinned people. It is a benign lesion that may develop more spotted elements over time. Once this lesion formed, it is presumed to persist throughout life. Rarely, this nevus may be present at birth, and more commonly the lesion becomes evident during infancy or early childhood. If you find a sudden increase in size, differential pigmentation, bleeding, irregular borders, etc., then you may go for a skin biopsy.

Induced abortion by medications is actually hormone-induced miscarriage, and it has side effects of hormones.

You can have one transvaginal scan to exclude the need for dilatation and evacuation. Wait for the scan report, and do not take hormones further. Let us disturb natural body hormones by externally induced hormones to come to normal. In case of heavy bleeding, abdominal pain, dizziness, and fainting, immediately report to the hospital.

"Hi doctor,I am having pain in my lower abdomen for last few months. I also have yellowish-greenish discharge sometimes. Please help.Thank you.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
The important part of history missing is whether you are sexually active or not. Greenish-yellowish discharge is seen in an infection called Trichomonas, a protozoan.
Vaginal infection is transmitted during sex so the partner is the source, so both have to be treated at a time, or else you will get infected next time sex. You may have white or yellow or grayish discharge with or without itching, foul smell, pain at the beginning of sex due to dryness  as the lubrication will be reduced  late towards the end when a fully erect penis touches the innermost vagina due to inflammation of the structures around the uterus pain radiating to the back and thighs. Associated with infection, bowel movement is affected, which is also a feature of gastritis. Bleeding of periods will be thicker, darker, may smell bad, and more days with spotting after the periods too. Pain throbs even before periods and last after periods too. Before treatment, confirm that you are not pregnant.
You and your partner can have
1. After lunch, Tablet Fluconazole 150 milligrams stat only one tablet, no repetition.
2. Tablet Azithromycin 1 gram stat only one tablet, no repetition one hour before food.
3. After dinner, Tablet Secnidazole forte two tablets stat no repetition.
Both of you should take all these medicines on the same day.
Later you have a capsule of Doxycyllin 100 milligrams twice a day for one week. Use vaginal wash or similar cleanser twice a day and vaginal pessary. Capsule Clingen forte, Candid-CL, or Cansoft CL once at night for five nights.
Your partner can have a local application of any antibiotic and antifungal cream Candid B or Candiderma or Lobate GM on the penis twice a day after washing for seven days. Do not have sex till the infection is fully gone. Do not treat it as delay may send the infection inwards and may affect both your and your partners future fertility.
Now if you are not sexually active- then we have to rule out Tuberculosis which is the only cause for a virgin to have vaginal discharge or a foreign body in the vagina or uterus, like a forgotten tampon or dressing. You will then need to have a local examination by a gynecologist and a pelvis scan.

The gauze you used was not sterile because you used scissors from a normal temperature rather than a disinfected or sterilized one.

The bleeding must eventually stop overnight after extraction and not continue for days. Please follow post-extraction instructions such as not vigorously brushing or gargling on the extracted region and avoiding hot and spicy food for at least three days. The ultimate aim is the blood clot that has to form, which further heals the gums. So please do not worry that you got tetanus.

If you are still sure that your condition is related to a suspensory ligament injury, an artificial erection test followed by a physical examination will be needed. This test is done by a urologist at his clinic where a small injection is given at the base of the penis to cause an erection, then penile anatomy is examined to see for any deformity. MRI pelvis is also an option to see for injury and its severity.","{'score': 81, 'clinical_accuracy': 15, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 7, 'transparency': 8}","{'score': 95, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 5, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,
My LMP was five months ago. I was spotting for three days during my LMP and got a positive strip test after seven days. My beta hCG level on the day of a positive result was 126, and after two days, it was 125. I am being told that I will get periods in two weeks but told to continue Folic acid and multivitamins and come for ultrasound in three weeks if no periods come. I have a history of miscarriages, and I am 35 years old. Can hCG injections help me or should I consult another doctor? Have I miscarried or there are still chances?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Unfortunately what your doctor has said is right. Spotting in early pregnancy is normal. But a fall or no rise beta HCG is a poor sign. Beta hCG is a hormone produced from fetal tissue. At a level of 25 mIUmL urine test is positive it doubles in 48 hours. So if the result of 7th is 125, then on 9th it should have been around 250 or more. Only healthy fetal tissue can produce an adequate amount of this hormone, so indirectly we get to know the health of the embryo even without seeing it. So it just means the fetal tissue is not growing. There can be lab errors, so to be on a safer side doctor has asked you to come for scan, to confirm. If you are worried about the repeated miscarriages, have yourself and your partner checked for any problem. Causes include blood sugar levels, thyroid hormone problems, or prolactin hormone abnormalities, any structural problems in the uterus or any problem in semen. Do not lose hope, if you are getting pregnant without much help, no matter what the outcome is, then you will surely have babies. I hope I have clarified your query, do write back if any more questions.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,
I am 31 years old and got married three years ago. This is my second pregnancy and I am currently 12 weeks pregnant. I had terminated my first pregnancy due to my bad health condition. I am a practicing architect and a teacher. My work schedule is about 9 to 10 working hours a day with a sedentary pattern.My first sonography was taken during my fourth week of pregnancy which showed that I have a septate uterus. During my eighth week, there was some bleeding observed in my vagina. On my gynecologist suggestion, I had another sonography which showed that everything was normal. Post that my doctor put me on bedrest for four weeks. I also had NT scan and dual marker blood test during my 12th week whose reports were normal. The doctor has recommended me to have a uterus stitched at 14 to 16 weeks.
Please guide me as to what precautions should I take with respect to food and lifestyle? As I have a successful architectural practice, I am under stress to complete the work on the given deadline. There has been a month backlog in work which may cause me severe financial issues. Is it advisable to return back to work with all the above complications? If yes, what precautions can I take?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
With working job and pregnancy, it is a difficult task. First being pregnant you need to relax. Do not stress out. Stress even mental stress has ill effects on pregnancy. Also, your weight is on the higher side. As you crossed 12 weeks, do a minimal routine physical activity. In diet, eat more vegetable and fruits with dry fruits. Avoid junk, processed, fried food. Also, stitch, you can put for the betterment of pregnancy. As far as now, your pregnancy is more important than anything else.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 93, 'clinical_accuracy': 19, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}"

I read your query and can understand your concern. The chances of transmitting HIV human immunodeficiency virus by single protected intercourse with an HIV-positive person are almost nil if a condom is used correctly, as in your scenario.

However, there are possibilities of transmission of STDs sexually transmitted diseases like the herpes simplex virus, which can be transmitted by skin-to-skin contact or kissing.

Some white liquid is leaking and some symptoms make me to feel like I am pregnant.  What should I do? I am confused because the kit shows negative. Please  help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have gone through your query. As the urine pregnancy test is negative, you are definitely not pregnant right now. Sometimes the premenstrual symptoms can also be similar to pregnancy because of similar hormones acting in both the situations. Some amount of menstrual disturbances are known side effects of the emergency contraceptive pill. So if you still have a doubt you can recheck it again after three to four days with an early morning sample. If still negative, you can be sure you are not pregnant. Just wait for a week for periods to come.  Please use a better and consistent method of birth control in the future like oral contraceptive pills or condoms, and repeated emergency contraceptive pill can take a toll on your hormonal balance.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Thank you for your query. You seem to be a female with optimal weight for your age, and I presume you to be an average height female. A couple may take as long as two years to conceive without any possible explanation. Since you are young, I do not see any reason why you should be concerned. Give yourself time, and I hope you will achieve pregnancy within a year. Try coitus in your most fertile period, roughly in the middle ten days of your cycle. Supposing you have 30 days cycle, then your fertile period will fall between 10th to 20th day of your period. You can also check your hormone status, such as thyroid and prolactin, to be sure. Since you are trying to conceive, you must have folic acid supplements 5 mg regularly and daily. It is to prevent specific neurological malformation of the baby. Once you are pregnant, Folic acid needs to be continued for the first three months of pregnancy.
I hope I have answered your query.

"Hi doctor,
I am a 32 year old male nurse, and I started having tremors in my hands when holding small objects like needles and catheters, since 3 to 4 years. It made me anxious as the tremors got worse every time I inject. Before, I had to hold my head still to hear the Korotkoffs sound while measuring blood pressure BP.  I always used to feel my head shaking. I remember being a kid and trying to play flute and trembling like crazy. My thyroid, calcium, sodium, potassium, chloride, magnesium, copper, antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, gamma-glutamyl transferase GGT, creatine kinase CK, etc., are all normal. I got an electrocardiogram ECG done a year back, and the reports said derivations in the muscles deltoid, biceps, common extensor of the fingers, and first inter-bone dorsal shows no signs of neurogenic or myogenic atrophy. My tremors get worse after exercise, and they are horrible when I am nervous. If I am opening a heavy door, the arm shakes, if I am doing push-ups or planks, my whole body trembles like crazy. If I need to push a little harder on the syringe while injection, the tremor starts. When I draw a medicine from a vial before administering, I have to close my arms to elbows, so I do not tremble. I do not smoke and drink, not even coffee or tea and eat the best I can. I am only taking Finasteride and topical Minoxidil for male hair loss from 10 years. I am very sad because it is getting difficult to perform my job and no one in my family understands. I never missed one day in work, I have passed through three neurologists. The first diagnosed it as essential tremor, and asked me to take Primidone, it was horrible and I had to quit. The second said that it was an exacerbated physiologic tremor, and the prescription was Rivotril Clonazepam. This diagnosis made me sad, as my family said over and over that it was all stress. Rivotril did calm me, but the tremor went on, so I quit it. The last neurologist after getting the electromyography said it was an essential tremor. I am confused now, as my mom trembles from hand but only when she is stressed. This tremor is not here all the time. When I hold my arm on a table and get down to get something, my arm trembles instantly. My writing is fine, and I only have asthma, male alopecia, and a history of septoplasty. I took Valerian, phytotherapy, acupuncture, but nothing helped. Why do I have these tremors? I often feel my muscles tired, so I took vitamin D. The tiredness felt better but the tremor is still on. Is it essential tremor?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com. I read your query with keen interest, and understand your concerns. From the available description, I am of the opinion that you are suffering from essential tremor. My observation is based on the following facts. 1. Exacerbation of symptoms when you are distressed. 2. Worsening of symptoms when you carry out activities like injecting, holding the syringe, etc. 3. Presence of tremor in certain positions. 4. The absence of lower body tremor, and lack of stress. 5. Increased tremor after physical activity.

Welcome to icliniq.com.

Delayed periods after the pills can be due to pregnancy or hormonal imbalance. If the urine pregnancy test is negative, then the pregnancy is unlikely. I will suggest you wait for a week more. If the period does not occur by then, repeat the urine pregnancy test. If still negative, then get your thyroid and prolactin hormone levels tested and further treatment should be done accordingly.

As you told your vision was fine with the glasses or lenses your doctor uses during eye exam and now you are having trouble with your glasses then most probably you need to recheck your glasses if they are dispensed according to your prescription or is there any error.

Do not worry about the periods, as you are aware that delay in periods can be due to obesity as you had suffered last time, however my compliments to you for reducing 30 lbs of weight attachment removed to protect patient identity, so we can conclude that delay is not due to being overweight. Then delay can be due to hormonal changes due to various medications specially birth control pills, etc., which you are not taking.

I understand your concerns.
Your symptoms are suggestive of vaginitis, which is mainly caused by a fungal infection. I suggest keeping the area dry and clean, drinking plenty of warm water, and following a soft diet. You should use antifungal medication and cream for topical application. It is recommended to wear cotton undergarments and consume more curd while reducing sugar intake. Avoid washing the vagina frequently with water. Additionally, please check your blood sugar levels. If you are sexually active, we should also rule out any sexually transmitted diseases STDs by conducting an STD panel. Your period may be delayed due to hormonal imbalance or vaginitis.

Dull pain in eyes and headache will be there in sinusitis and can also happen due to refractive error, but your tests are normal. You should also start medications for migraine.

It is not uncommon for women to experience changes in their menstrual cycle or urinary symptoms after having sex for the first time. However, it is essential to rule out any potential infections or complications.The pain you are experiencing during your period could be due to various factors, such as hormonal changes, uterine contractions, or even the physical act of intercourse itself. The burning sensation while urinating can be an infection like a urinary tract infection UTI or an irritation in the urinary tract. To address your concern, it is best to visit a healthcare professional who can perform a thorough examination and recommend appropriate tests, if needed, to determine the cause of your symptoms. If UTI, your doctor will prescribe antibiotics or treatments to alleviate your discomfort.In the meantime, drink plenty of water to help flush out your system and practice good hygiene. If you are using any new feminine products or lubricants, consider discontinuing their use until you can consult with a healthcare provider.

I understand your concern.
As per the history and the photos provided attachment removed to protect the patients identity, the current face wash which your sister is using is not medicated. To treat acne, medicated products are needed to break down the bacterial contamination and reduce sebum secretion. Firstly, I would like to brief you about the issue to get an idea regarding the same. Acne is caused due to a number of factors, including hormonal fluctuations, diet, hydration, women- ovarian syndromes, which are characterized by irregularities in the menstrual cycle, skin type, and genetics. For your sister, please ensure her periods are regular. If there are irregularities, please consult a gynaecologist for medication.
As of now, I suggest you follow the below steps,
1. Start Cipla saslic DS Salicylic acid face wash in the morning and night. Apply the face wash and gently massage on face and wash off within one minute.
2. Apply Peroclin 2.5 Benzoyl peroxide 2.5 and Clindamycin 1 gel on the pimples in the morning and at night after face wash.
3. Take Limcee 500 mg vitamin C chewable tablet after food at night daily for one month.
4. Avoid oily food, sweets, milk, and dairy products, and consume at least ten glasses of water a day.
I suggest you follow-up after one month to check the progress.

I immediately wised up and put on a condom but that did not get far as I got flaccid right after and then took a shower. I had a full panel of STD sexually transmitted disease tests done three times 66 days, 68 days, and 84 days and it has come back negative to rule out hepatitis a,b, and c, RPR rapid plasma reagin, Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, HSV herpes simplex virus 1, and 2. I got tested for HIV human immunodeficiency virus as well at week 10 twice 66 days, 68 days, and also at week 12 84 days and also at 89 days, all non-reactive. I have had the following types of HIV tests done all non-reactive Generation 4 antigenantibody wreflex - non-reactive - 66 days. Generation 4 antigenantibody wReflex - non-reactive - 68 days. Generation 4 antigenantibody wReflex - non-reactive - 84 days. Advance Duo - non-reactive - 89 days. I am going to go for a 101-day test with generation 4 soon as the CDCCenter for Disease Prevention and Control states that three months after the latest exposure is conclusive. I have no immune problems, no chemotherapy, no PEP, and no other reasons for delaying anything. I just keep reading things online CDC, forums, research publications and what people are posting and I am increasing my anxiety to the point where I am getting constantly worried. Some people say three months and then at six months for conclusiveness, etc. I have spoken to my doctor, and he states I have nothing to worry about, I have spoken to an HIV hotline counselor and they have stated I should move on. I have also spoken to another doctor who states that the tests that I have done already are absolutely good enough to firmly establish that I am HIV-negative. Another doctor also assured me that the tests clearly and without a doubt prove that I am not infected with HIV or any other STI sexually transmitted infection from the brief encounter and that there is no reason for further testing and no medically sound reason for me to worry. There is no need for additional testing and to continue to test is a waste of my time and money. I should have complete confidence in the testslaboratory results. There is no possibility that the test results will change related to the exposure of the report. I guess this anxiety is just controlling me in ways that it should not. What confidence should I have in the above tests? Is there a possibility of a false negative in the three blood tests? Should I just put this to rest now and move on with my life or I am just feeding my anxiety? Are these results conclusive? Should I test after six months? Should I take that 94-day three months test for reassurance?
Thank you.","Hello,
I appreciate you signing up on icliniq. You now have exclusive access to expert medical opinion. HIV human immunodeficiency virus infection has a window period of one to three months during which the test results can be false negative. However, even as per WHO World Health Organization, all results are considered conclusive at 12 weeks after the high-risk exposure. Techniques such as the fourth-generation combo tests that you have undertaken are even more specific and help to detect as early as six weeks. As your test results are negative even at three months of exposure, you can be assured that you have not acquired any HIV. There is no need for further testing. You can rest your fears and go ahead confidently.
Thank you for choosing icliniq.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hi doctor,
My daughter is 14 years old. I wonder whether she has herniated disc. Because, she has all the symptoms except the numbness in legs and feet. It hurts in the lower part of my back. Usually a herniated disc is from sports injury and heavy lifting. But, she recently have not had any sports injuries or have not done any heavy lifting. But, in the past she had. Her back has been hurting when she cough, sneeze, sit or even walk down my porch steps. It has been hurting for may be two to three weeks now. I have not heard people of her age have a slipped herniated disc and other stuff. Please help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com. Let us analyze different reasons for back pain of her age. The most important is a back sprain rather than a disc prolapse. We also have to make sure that your daughter is not suffering from urinary tract infection. It would be nice to know if she has any symptoms of burning urine, bad smelling urine or peeing too much in the night or any fever. Also kidney stones are a possibility. I would suggest using Tylenol and a muscle relaxant, with stretching exercises and obtain a urine test. If she did not feel better by doing the stretching exercises and Tylenol then we would have to think more in terms of a prolapsed disc or other gynecological causes. I would suggest you to get a plain KUB kidney, ureter, bladder x-ray to look for renal stones and urinalysis with culture. Take Tylenol two pills every 8 hours for pain on as needed basis and Flexeril 5 mg Cyclobenzaprine every 12 hours as needed for pain.","{'score': 83, 'clinical_accuracy': 15, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 8}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 82, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}"

Based on the lab report, it looks like he is having typhoid fever. The prescribed medicine Xone Ceftriaxone is used in the treatment of typhoid.

"Hello doctor,
I am a software professional. I work in shifts from 2 PM to 1130 PM. Recently, I got a complete health check-up done and found to have microscopic hematuria. Before this health check-up, I used to take medicines for headaches Saridon and Headset tablets. I used to drink alcohol thrice weekly. Now sometimes I get headaches, feel dizzy, and have gastric problems like burning sensation in the stomach. I do not have any other problems like pain in the abdomen, back pain, etc. Is this a severe threat to my health or kidneys? Is this curable? What type of diet do I need to follow?

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have gone through all your reports attachment removed to protect patient identity, and except for the microscopic hematuria, all your reports are fine and there is nothing to worry about.
Regarding the microscopic hematuria, it could be due to subclinical UTI Urinary Tract Infection, which happens due to poor hygiene or due to inadequate drinking of water. Since you are a working professional, I presume you do not get much time to care about your diet and general things such as drinking enough water on time. Due to this, the urine keeps turning acidic and makes it a good environment for the local microbial flora to grow and cause UTI. It is not at all a threat as of now. UTI in men can be difficult to treat with because of resistance of organisms to many antibiotics. However, I suggest you try doing the following things
Make sure you drink at least 4 liters of water every day and keep yourself hydrated.
I will also advise a course of tablet Co-trimoxazole Septra-DS twice daily for seven days.
Since you have minor gastric discomfort, a course of tablet Omeprazole 20 mg once daily before breakfast for two weeks will be helpful.
Repeat urine test and RFT Renal Function Test after two weeks and send me the reports.
Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking medicines after their consent. Till then take the medicines and most importantly drink enough water. Take care.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"

"Hi doctor,
My father was diagnosed with acute paronychia on his right toe nine days back. He took tablets Augmentin BD, tablet Vizylac BD, and T- bact ointment for seven days, and that somewhere improved the condition, but the pain and watery-like discharge are there. So help, what to do now?","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern.
I have gone through the details and the images the attachments are removed to protect the patients identity provided from your end. Paronychia, as you already might know, is an infection and inflammatory reaction of the tissue on the sides of the nail fold. Most often is caused due to trauma, excess washing and using strong chemicals, due to ingrown nails and cutting off nails, and so on. They may get infected most often by bacteria and sometimes by fungal pathogens as well. They usually cause pain, discomfort, redness, pus formation, and tenderness.
As you have mentioned using Augmentin Amoxicillin and Clavulanate and T- bact ointment Mupirocin, which are great medications in reducing the infection, I would like to let you know that the presence of watery discharge is normal and may take time to reduce.
I suggest,
1. However, once the infection is usually down, the remaining infected area around the nail may be manually excised by a doctor in person to reduce the presence of bacterial elements within them.
2. Warm salt water soaking may be done twice daily for ten minutes every three weeks until the symptoms and redness are reduced.
3. Tablet Diptase Aceclofenac may be consumed orally after food in the morning and at night for three days. They help in reducing inflammation and redness along with pain.
In case of a previous history of allergies to Aceclofenac, this medication may be avoided.
4. Continue using T-bact ointment after the swab test.
5. Since you have mentioned the presence of secretion, I would like to advise you to make sure the secretion is tested using a swab test where the secretion is collected and a culture and sensitivity testing is done to check the type of bacteria present and the antibiotics which they are most sensitive to, may be prescribed to your father immediately to reduce further infection and inflammation as well. Usually, the test results take three days to arrive, and till then, T-bact ointment may be continued.
This test may be taken at any laboratory or by a doctor in person.
6. Tablet Limcee 500 mg vitamin C chewable tablet may be consumed twice daily after food which may be chewed and consumed for two months. They help with reducing the chances and recurrences of infections.
7. Make sure to avoid tight slippers, further trauma, or using harsh chemicals for cleaning the area to avoid secondary infections.
8. Further, I would also like you to consult a doctor in person for the swab test and for the doctor to examine the area if it is causing excess discomfort for further management options from their end.
Kindly consult with your doctor before taking medications.
I hope it helps.
Kind regards.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,
My problem is I have been masturbating for a long time, and now I am facing problems. I cannot stop my urine, and it is hard to control. When I urinate, it just comes out a little, and I think my bladder is weak. My penis is strong only for a few minutes and goes down soon. Also, my penis head is very sensitive. Kindly help.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your distress, and I will do my best to advise you. Masturbation usually does not cause trouble if it is done on an occasional basis and avoiding friction by lubrication and clean hygiene. From your presentation and mentioned issues, I will take it one by one. The urgency to pass urine and getting weak stream or few drops even does not mean your bladder is weak especially for a 29 years young man. It means that you have an inflammation, causing an increase in frequency and urgency and no urine. Therefore you have a few drops or weak stream. Due to inflammation, you do not have good erection and increased penis sensitivity. Inflammation in the urinary and genital system can be from the bladder, prostate, or urethra. It can be an infection that happens if you are sexually active. Work out on diagnosis will need urine culture, semen culture, and ultrasound to detect if your bladder has any cause. If you are sexually active, then I need to request more tests otherwise, for now, those are enough. Keep updating me after your tests are done, and I will follow your case until complete recovery.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"

Also, I have attached my latest blood test reports.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com. I appreciate your efforts for uploading the laboratory reports attachment removed to protect patient identity. You are suffering from fatigue syndrome and the reason for that is you have low vitamin and nutrient levels, deranged liver functions although little one, high cholesterol and deranged lipid profile. Yes, you may use the Amway product. It is a good brand for dermatological and dietary supplements. But there is little to no research available from third party or independent unbiased researchers. So, the safety of dietary products and other drug interactions with your other medications are not much documented. Your supplements are good for vitamins. You have to lower your weight, increase physical activity and have to keep a check on your cholesterol levels to keep in normal range. Try diet modifications too. If these things do not work I will suggest you to start some lipid lowering medicine like Statin. Avoid alcohol and smoking, if you do. It is hazardous for your liver which already is not working good. I request you to get blood tests done for HbSAg hepatitis B surface antigen and Anti-HCV human papillomavirus both by ELISA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. And to get and ultrasound of complete abdomen. Meanwhile, you can take capsule SeaMega for fatigue and your cholesterol.

"Hello doctor,
Hope you can help me, please. I am a young breast cancer survivor in my twenties who had cancer a few years ago. I am now cancer free. However more recently than this, a doctor gave me a wrong diagnosis and told me he thought cancer had spread to my brain. It took weeks to get the brain scan and the results to find out it was clear. During this time I was panicking a lot and even now this event has passed a few months ago I am left with fatigue, internal shaking, head pressure and I jump out my skin to the slightest noise. I have all these anxiety symptoms, however, I am not worried about cancer anymore as the results were clear, but I seem to be stuck in some kind of stress response. I have tried Prozac and Citalopram just in case these would help and had a serious reaction to both of them face going completely numb, vibrating and too dizzy to walk. I am not sure counseling would really help because as I mentioned the event that made me like this has now passed and I feel fine about it and do not think about it anymore. In fact, I am worried that might make it worse as I am trying to forget about it. I am not anxious anymore. I just seem stuck with these symptoms. I would just like to know if you have heard of this before and is it normal that this can happen? Also, do you have any suggestions what I can do? Should these symptoms go away in time?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I can understand your problem. The symptoms you have mentioned suggest anxiety only. When the doctor told you mistakenly that cancer has spread to the brain, that was the trigger for anxiety. Even now when you are clear but the anxiety triggered by that event is resulting in the symptoms you are having. The symptoms like fatigue, internal shaking, head pressure, startle like response even on slightest of noise, etc., are part of persisting anxiety only. Yes, I came across many such patients who developed such symptoms after diagnosing with some serious issue. No need to get worried about that. Such type of anxiety is common. I would advise you to keep yourself busy and distract yourself from any thoughts. Try to follow a healthy lifestyle and take high protein diet rich in complex carbohydrates and low in fats. The symptoms will go away with time, no need to get worried. If you could not tolerate Prozac or Escitalopram then the probable reason was first dose effects of SSRIs. You could have prevented this by starting with a low dose that is 5 mg for Escitalopram or 20 mg for Prozac. I hope your thyroid hormone levels are normal. If these are normal then no need to get worried.

"I noticed some change in my throat as if my right tonsil was enlarged, but Im not sure. what coud it be? i dont have pain at all in throat, just a headache and ear pain","Hi
Thanks for briefing regarding the problem in concern. I had a detailed look at the picture you have sent. There is absolutely nothing that you need to worry about. Tonsils represents the first line of defence for the body from the oropharyngeal side. Any inflammation indicates on going inflammation in the throat due to a infectious or non infectious cause. Its common to see tonsils enlarge on one side. However, the size and appearacne of the tonsils dont indicate any form of cancer or malignancy and hence there is absolutely nothing that you need to worry about. Please keep note of the following points to prevent any source of inflammatory agents creating a response in the throat causing inflammation of the throat and tonsils. 1. Salt water gargling 6 to 8 times a day as long as possible. 2. Avoid cold fizzy beverages, avoid spicy, oily and junk food. 3. Keep sipping on boiled warm water every 2 hrs as long as possible. 4. Stay away from dust and smoke by wearing an n95 mask. The above precautionary measures do go a long way in keep in the inflammatory activity in the throat at its least. Do keep a watch on the size of the tonsil, if there is any rapid growth or ulcerations over the surface, do get it examined in person with an ent specialist. As of now there is nothing to worry about. I hope this answers your query. If there is anything more that you need to know or enquire, kindly do let us know and we will get back to you ASAP.

So is the result correct or false positive due to Decapeptyl 0.1 mg Triptorelin Injections? Please guide.
Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I think you have done a urine pregnancy test. However, as you have tried intrauterine insemination IUI, having an exact and clear pregnancy status is better. Better to have a serum beta-hCG blood pregnancy test. You can repeat the beta-hCG test after 48 hours for proper pregnancy monitoring. If the second beta-hCG test level shows a 60 percent increase over the first, then it is a healthy growing pregnancy. However, if the second beta-hCG test level shows an increase of less than 60 percent, it could be an alarming pregnancy outside the uterus. But if the beta-hCG level after 48 hours is less than the first one, it is a miscarriage. In case of abnormal symptoms like bleeding, pain, or dizziness, consult the specialist immediately. Consult your specialist doctor, talk to them, and take medications with their consent. I advise taking Acide folique 0.4 mg Folic acid daily. If you have been treated for any disease, have a check for thyroid abnormalities which can cause miscarriage and neurodevelopmental problems in a child.

It is normal for children below the age of six months to pass stool 10 to 20 times a day or once in two or three days. Both are normal and it is not considered as constipation or diarrhea.

My wife is 27 years old and   13 weeks pregnant now. As per suggestion from doctor, we went for a double marker test. It is found that trisomy 21  NT risk is 186 and doctor suggested for amniocentesis procedure. Now I am confused and do not know what to do. My wife scared that the procedure is risky and painful. Please explain us about it.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
From the information you have given, the risk of having a baby with chromosomal problem that is trisomy 21 or Downs syndrome is 186. I believe you would have received detailed counseling about this condition prior to and after going through the screening test. Downs syndrome babies are very cheerful generally but are differently abled and have varying degrees of reduced IQ intelligence quotient or mental retardation. Downs syndrome babies could also have heart or kidney defects and a shortened life span. What this screening test means is that if 86 women have such a result one of them will have a Downs baby whereas 85 out of 86 will have a normal baby.
Amniocentesis is a test done to confirm the chromosomes of the baby and has a risk of 1 in 100 procedures resulting in miscarriage. The fluid around the baby is taken using a needle with local anesthesia and ultrasound guidance and sent for testing. On balance the chance of a Downs baby is more the the risk of miscarriage by amniocentesis. Usually the quick results are available in 72 hours and the final report takes three weeks. The options after getting the reports can be different for different couples. If the chromosomes are normal then we all are happy. If Downs syndrome is confirmed then some couples prepare themselves for the birth and care of the baby. Whereas some choose to end the pregnancy. This is why the decision to go through amniocentesis should be taken fairly quickly so that all options are available for us.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 19, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 9, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

For example, there could be various reasons why your left breast is sunken, and your right breast is lumpy, such as differences in breast tissue, changes in hormone levels, or other medical conditions. Additionally, some people naturally have asymmetrical breasts, meaning that one breast is different from the other in size, shape, or position. It is also possible that you have a breast condition, such as fibrocystic breast changes or a breast infection, which can cause changes in the appearance and feel of your breasts.
Hope this helps.
Thanks and take care.","{'score': 91, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,I need to lose weight and wanted to take medications for this specifically because I am planning to get pregnant in the next six months. I cannot lose weight the normal way. I try to eat less but I get terrible migraines. Please help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I read your query and understand your concern.
You are having a weight gain problem. The reason behind it could be any of the below
Cushing syndrome, or endocrine problems if present.
PCOD polycystic ovarian disease ovarian cyst problem.
Hypothyroidism.
Severe depression and anxiety state.
To know the exact cause a detailed history is taken and a physical examination is done and then if needed further workup is planned. For example, If hypothyroidism is suspected then serum TSH thyroid stimulating hormone and T4 estimation are done. As far as weight reduction is concerned physical exercise and less carbohydrate and less fat diet are helpful. Regular one-hour calorie burn by cycling, brisk walking, running, etc are useful. In your country, Orlistat drug microcrystalline cellulose and Sodium starch cellulose that inhibits lipase enzyme and decreases fat absorption, is an approved drug but should be taken after discussion with a doctor and after ruling out other causes. Gastric loop banding, a surgical procedure is also available to reduce weight. Consult a physician for examination with keeping all this in mind. I hope this helps you.

I have had muscle twitches from head to toe for 12 months. About four weeks ago, my left thumb started twitching involuntarily, and it would not stop even during sleep.

"Hello doctor,
I do not know why but I make a virtual world for myself. I always fake things about myself, tell untrue stories. When I remember people, like my ex-boyfriend, I imagine a conversation between me and him that had never happened and I feel happy. I keep imagining all that I wanted to do but have never done. I talk to people in my mind. I meet them, I see them, I laugh and cry in my mind. I am tired of imagining and failing in everything in real life. I even sometimes imagine the conversations with dead people.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
People use imagination as a defense or escape from reality. Some degree of imagination is alright because it makes us imagine a goal, feeling of happiness, if achieved, hence motivate a person for a target or goal but the use of excessive imagination can lead to wastage of time and serve as a distraction from your real life goals. You can reduce this by giving some aversive stimulation to yourself like a tire rubber band in the hand bullet as much as possible so that you feel pain when you will stop doing this. Set a goal in real life and be passionate about it. Try to achieve it at any cost. If you still find it hard to overcome, then I would advise you to consult a local psychiatrist.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"

"Hello doctor,
Two months ago, I got my penis bent during rough masturbation. It is still bent a bit at the head and the shaft. During sex, I feel something is wrong. I also feel that my penis has become more flaccid and swollen. It feels a little bit larger and very soft. All these problems started right after my penis got bent. Before this, everything was fine. Currently, I have sex once in five to six days. I have a little pain when I enter my wifes vagina, which is not very intense. And I have a burning sensation after ejaculation.
When my penis got bent, I did not hear any popping sound nor feel any intense pain. I get a normal erection even now, but it does not last. I last longer when there is a long gap between two sexual intercourse. Sometimes, I feel a burning sensation after I urinate. I got my penis examined by a sexologist, who said it to be a disorder of the nerves. He denied it to be Peyronies disease after checking my penis and pressing here and there in and around the penis and asking me if I felt pain. I was having normal pain. He did not advise any test, and he just said that it would be cured in a month. He prescribed me really expensive medicines to take. What should I do? I am very scared for my sex life. Please help me. I am uploading some images of my penis at rest and in an erection.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I appreciate that you have come up with the issue before wasting money, as many people do. Also, you have described your problem very clearly. I have seen the attached photos attachment removed to protect patient identity. It is not a penile fracture from the history and the look. There is a slight downward tilt, which does not warrant any treatment. The pain at the start of sex is due to less lubrication use your saliva profusely over your penis and your wifes genitals before penetration. The appearance of the penis is also very normal. Erection is dynamic and depends on many environmental and mental states. The decreased erection is transient and variable many times and will return to normal in time. With increasing sexual experience, the pleasure and erection may be less occasionally. For burning after ejaculation, I suggest increasing the frequency of sexual intercourse to twice a week at least. If it is persistent, then get a urine routine before and after the prostatic massage. I suggest you try the tablet Tadaflo Tadalafil 5 mg every evening. It is a very low dose of Tadalafil for 15 days.","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"

"Hello doctor,I am 22 years old, and I have a 5 cm cyst on my left ovary and a uterine fibroid the size of a grape. My periods have always been regular except this cycle, I am six days late. I took a pregnancy test a couple of days ago, and it was negative. Is this normal? I have also gained some weight suddenly in the past month, which is odd as I always had my weight under control. Kindly help.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I read your query and understand your concern.
Fibroids of size less than 5 cm need not be treated if asymptomatic. But any fibroid-causing symptoms need to be treated. Symptoms include excessive bleeding during periods, irregular periods, severe pain during periods, excessive watery vaginal discharge, difficulty in passing urine, or severe back ache. At this young age, these will not happen, and you do not have them.
An ovarian cyst is nothing but a follicle of this period that did not rupture, so there are no periods. Indirectly due to hormone imbalance. It can be left untreated and will disappear on its own. The basic problem is your weight. Your expected weight is 52 to 55 kg. This extra fat, probably due to poor dietary habits and lack of good exercise, will be converted into hormones interfering with ovulation.
To regulate this, I would suggest the following
Birth control pills, which contain 21 pills Consult a specialist doctor, discuss with them, and take medications with their consent. One tablet twice a day is to be taken for ten days. You will have periods after seven to ten days after stopping the pill.
Have a healthy diet with low calories and regular exercise for an hour.
I hope this helps.

Watching excess porn.
Receiving less foreplay from a partner or lack of knowledge regarding foreplay and female masturbation.
Having an affair gives you a guilty feeling and may result in premature ejaculation.
Lack of exercise or obesity.
You must check FBS fasting blood sugar or PPBS post-prandial blood sugar to rule out diabetes. Check your BP blood pressure and free T3, T4, and TSH thyroid stimulating hormone levels to rule out thyroid issues. You can use the tablet Duralast 30 mg Dapoxetine as a temporary solution.

Will the person in question face a higher risk of having lung disease in the future? Now my age is 21. Is pleural thickening reversible in my case? I would like to go abroad for a job. Will pleural thickening create any problems with my working visa? If yes, what can I do? Please help.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Please relax. You have probably healed your TBtuberculosis and there is nothing to worry about right now.
Pleural thickening has happened as a result of the effusion you had. It is a way of healing that the body does when effusion happens. It will not get worse with age and you will not get TB again. There are no higher chances of cancer also related to that. A large number of people suffer from this and it does not affect life in any way.
Thickening usually does not get reversed. It will remain there. The only problem which you might face in a visa interview is if they require your chest x-ray to be done and then thickening will be seen. Now, it is evident that they will get your other tests done to rule out active TB, which should come negative.
Certain countries bar people who have had TB. But, I do not think such policies are present in working visas. I would recommend you read the specific country website and also consult some agents about this before you fill out the medical declaration. Except for the visa, it will not cause any issues in your life.

"Hi doctor,
We were prescribed Orofer but got Orofer XT for iron deficiency. Is it fine to have Orofer XT instead of Orofer?","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Iron deficiency anemia is very common. You should start taking iron supplements only after an accurate diagnosis is made. Because if taken in over dosage it may cause health problems. Iron supplements should not be given in iron overload, thalassemia and non iron deficiency anemia. In pregnancy, iron supplements are taken prophylactically for prevention of iron deficiency.Orofer XT contains Iron Ferrous ascorbate and Folic acid.  It is used for prevention and treatment of iron deficiency anemia and supplies maintenance dose of folic acid also. An overdose of iron with folic acid supplements can pose serious health risks, which includes paleness, weak and quick heart beat, nausea and vomiting. Orofer also contains Iron and Folic acid but the iron present in it is in combination with polymaltose complex which is tolerated well than other ferrous salts like ferrous ascorbate Orofer XT. The slower absorption of Orofer increases its safety profile and hence the side effects like gastric irritation, nausea, vomiting and constipation are less with the use of Orofer. After three months of treatment, both Orofer and Orofer XT give the same result. Hence, I suggest you to prefer Orofer over Orofer XT if you have gastric problem and not able to tolerate iron well.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 96, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 8}","{'score': 77, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 8}"

"Hi doctor,
I used to get throat infection whenever I drink cold water. Due to weather also drinking water gets cold. Even that leads to throat infection. What measure shall I take to protect myself from throat infection?","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Many patients come to me with this complaint of frequent sore throat. First I would say do not worry about this. We must evaluate if there is any pathogenic organism residing in the throat and causing recurrent infections. For the same a throat swab culture and sensitivity test is required based on which we can proceed further treatment. If tonsils are the foci of infection they frequently enlarge and cause obstructive symptoms like difficulty in swallowing, pain while swallowing and also bad smell from mouth. A physical examination by an otolaryngologist can easily diagnose tonsillar enlargement. Rather you can send me a selfie with open mouth taking care the back of throat is visible and tongue does not obstruct the view. Frequently the condition can be allergic when it does not result in pain and pus but causes frequent itching, throat discomfort and nasal discharge and sneezing. On the inflamed mucosa secondarily bacteria can multiply and produce an infection.
Throat infection can cause pain and infection in the ear due to continuity with ear through the eustachian tube. Eustachian tube which serves to maintain equal pressure on both sides of eardrum and drain ear secretions can result in ear pain and fullness when blocked. As general precautions in addition to salt water gargles, take steam inhalation also. During throat pain, use Chlorhexidine gargles. Mix 5 tablespoon Chlorhexidine in plain water and gargle the throat and spit out the fluid. Also let us know if you have any additional symptoms like cough, vomiting, fever, headache, giddiness, etc., which can help us to make more decisive diagnosis. Also let us know about your habits and please mention any medication you are taking for diabetes or hypertension, etc.","{'score': 95, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 5, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 97, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,
I am a-29-year old female on dialysis. I just started having a sharp shooting pain through the left side of my chest to the back side of my left shoulder neck. My left arm feels weak and the pain goes away and then comes back. Should I be concerned? Kindly help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I can understand your concern but need to know more about the symptoms, like precipitating factors, factors that increase pain, etc. This pain does not appear to be cardiac pain or something serious. I suggest you get one ECG Electrocardiogram done just to rule out heart disease. Cardiac pain typically occurs on exertion and relieves with rest. Also, your age does not support heart disease. Mostly it is gastritis and reflux disease. Do you also have upper abdominal pain, nausea, bloating, burping, increase in pain on food, sour water feeling in your throat, or chest burning, these symptoms can be associated with your problem. I suggest you follow these steps
1. You should avoid a fatty, oily, and spicy diet.
2. Have a walk after having food instead of taking a rest.
3. Have multiple small meals instead of heavy meals.
4. Have regular sleep habits and avoid stress.
5. Have lots of green leafy vegetables and fruits.
6. Avoid smoking and alcohol if any.
7. You can get a prescribed tablet of Pan DSR 40 mg Pantoprazole before breakfast once a day for two weeks.
I hope this helps you.","{'score': 68, 'clinical_accuracy': 15, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 3, 'transparency': 7}","{'score': 80, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 5, 'transparency': 8}","{'score': 75, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"

welcome to icliniq
hope youre doing well
I have read your history and with this precise history number of factors can be responsible like as you mentioned such as emotional stress, menopausal, medication use pr thermoregulatory response.
Menopausal flashes typically lasts for 3-5 minutes  can recur upto 20 times a day. Quiting medication i.e. Beta blockers can cause flushes too and since you already have taken the dose , it should improve.
The best you can do is avoidance of hot beverages, spicy foods, cured meats, and alcohol. These may help you.   If you continue to suffer from hot flushes, I would advise you to write it in a  diary for a week, note duration and frequency  consult your physician as detailed history and physical examination is needed to establish definitive diagnosis.

"Hello doctor,My partner is a 34 year old female. We had sex on the 11th day of her cycle. Is there any possibility that she gets pregnant?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I went through your post.
Any unprotected intercourse at any point of the menstrual period is associated with a risk of pregnancy, except during the menstrual period.
You have had unprotected sex during the mid-menstrual cycle. So, it is possible that she can get pregnant.
If it has been less than 72 hours, then she can take an I-pill Levonorgestrel. If it has been more than 72 hours, then you will have to wait till her expected date of periods.

"Hi doctor,
I am 21 and suffering from tinnitus from last four months. The sound in the ears is not constant. It is changing. Sometimes, it is loud enough that I can hear it even in a crowded place and sometimes so low I cannot detect in a normal environment and the most important of all with a loud noise like train horn it is taking a peak and when the sound goes off it comes back to normal. My doctor told me this is due to cold and prescribed some antibiotics. But it did not work. So he told me to visit an ENT specialist. After visiting an ENT specialist, he told me my ears are fine but I should do an audiogram. And also given me some antibiotics. There was no hearing loss in the audiogram. And the medicines also did not work. Then I again visited the doctor. This time he told me there is nothing to worry about and sent me back home. What I want to ask is, if there are any other tests that could detect why this is happening and how this could be treated?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
You are suffering from fluctuating tinnitus for four months as you have said. Tinnitus ringing sensation in the ear may be due to problems of the ear or problems not related to the ear. Ear problems causing tinnitus are generally associated with hearing loss. But that is ruled out in your case as your audiogram is normal. Some investigations need to be carried out 1. Complete blood count. 2. Lipid profile. 3.Serum TSH. 4.To rule out any vascular lesion in the ear though rare I would suggest an MR angiography of the head-neck vessels. Ear causes unlikely in your case, as audiogram is normal sensorineural hearing loss due to any cause, otosclerosis, Menieres disease. Non-ear causes anemia, dyslipidemia, diabetes, vascular lesions of the head-neck. Very rarely, some lesions of the blood vessels in the ear may cause tinnitus. In many cases, a definite cause of the tinnitus cannot be found. I would suggest you go for the investigations as suggested. If no cause is found, you should go for tinnitus retraining therapy. An audiologist may help. Avoid loud sounds, have a diet comprising of green vegetables and fruits containing beta-carotene mango, papaya, etc..","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 88, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 7, 'transparency': 8}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"

"Hello doctor,
My wife is 35 years old and first time pregnant. She got pregnant naturally. She is running into 18 weeks and five days as of today. No history of any fertility treatment ever. Last week, she had bleeding with clots and tissues one pad soaked each time twice in four days interval. We consulted a local doctor and had a 4D ultrasound scan. The fetus is without anomaly but she has low-lying placenta covering the os and a 14x8 mm retroplacental clot was observed. She also has cervical polyp but the local doctor observed bleeding is not due to the polyp. Along with total bed rest, the local doctor prescribed the following
Injection Proluton once so far,
Tablet Miprogen 200 mg twice a day for five days.
Tablet Texakind 500 mg thrice a day for five days.
Tablet Duvaldin retard twice a day.
She has a tendency of sinus and recently had cough. Hence, the doctor prescribed antibiotics also.
Questions
She is still bleeding, though lesser in quantity maybe 20-30 drops. Is the above medication enough? Do you recommend any change?
Is this officially placenta previa situation?
We want to fly back home on the 25th having one and a half hours flight journey. Is this safe? I read contradictory views on cabin pressure factor.
Are coughing and sneezing creating jerks contributing to bleeding?
Since last USG mentioned covering the os, does it mean there is a very slim chance of placenta moving away from cervix os in the coming weeks?
Is this small but frequent bleeding fatal to the fetus? How to determine if it is time for blood transfusion?
Sorry for the long post. This is our first time and we are very anxious due to ongoing issues. Please guide us. Thanks.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Yes, the above medication will be effective and safe. The minimal bleeding will also settle down soon. Since it has been detected by scan, then definitely it is placenta previa.  At this point of time, it is better to avoid journey as it may increase the amount of bleeding. The placenta will definitely move up slowly as the pregnancy advances. Since the bleeding has reduced, it will not have any fatal effects on the baby. Regular timely scans will help to know when intervention is required and your gynecologist is the right person to decide.

"Hello doctor,
I want to ask about something peculiar that happened to me one day before. I went for physiotherapy for a lower back pain problem that I had. After lying with my face down and getting the therapy hot radiation, vibration massage with a device, cables that send electricity and activate the muscles, the last part was a massage session of a few minutes. The area treated was the glutes lower back and upper half. After a couple of minutes, I started feeling that I was about to get an erection, and I did not want that, so I tried somehow to interrupt it. Before I understood what was going on, I was ejaculating probably a relatively lower amount of semen than in a normal ejaculation.
The incident was shocking to me. As you can understand, I would never have the purpose for something like that in a room that provides medical services. Unfortunately, the girl doing the massage continued for a couple more minutes, and I hope she did not realize or even suspect that something like this had happened. After a search on the internet, I found something similar, like unintentional ejaculation in a tough workout-gym session due to intense muscle contraction. Naturally, I am upset about the situation. The incident by itself was kind of traumatic as no sexual mood or purpose existed in this room, and I would not like to have such an experience in a public place. However, I am really worried, thinking if this is due to muscle contraction or premature ejaculation, as I have never had anything like this before. I cannot imagine the girl who did the physiotherapy understanding this, and I am incredibly anxious as I have more sessions as advised by my orthopedist. What could be the reason for this, and what would you suggest? Kindly help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern, and this is quite normal. It can happen to anyone. There is no need to be stressed because of this. We routinely see many times during ultrasonography of the lower abdomen when the patient ejaculates unintentionally. There are many ways erection and ejaculation can occur. Even if it happens during sleep and there is nightfall. Nerves can get stimulated by sight, touch, sight, hearing, etc. So it is normal to have it.

"Hello doctor,
My age is 29, and I am pregnant for the second time. I am 11 weeks and 6 days pregnant. Recently, my doctor advised me of a double marker test. The PAPP-A is 0.48 MoM, and FB-hCG is 0.33 MoM. The calculated risk for trisomy 1319 is 13142 and shows low risk, and the calculated risk for trisomy 21 is below the cut-off and shows a low risk.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I thoroughly read your query and understand your concern.
Biochemistry two hormones levels, nuchal translucency, family history, and female age all combine to calculate risk. It would be better if you send me reports of the same and some detailed history. As you said, the calculated risk for trisomy is 13, and even if 18, it is almost negligible but with serum markers only. Whereas trisomy 21 shows risk below the cut-off value, I think you are telling less than 1250. PAPP-A pregnancy-associated plasma protein A should be 0.5 MoM or more, and yours is a bit less, 0.48 MoM. Actually, the beta hCG human chorionic gonadotropin is less and should be 1 MoM or more. Still, your age is not risky for trisomy 21. Whereas, if family history is negative for an anomaly, then it is also a good point for calculating overall risk. Do have a scan around 12 plus weeks for nuchal translucency, and if it is less than 2.9 mm, then it is normal. Do not be tense. Most of the points are in favor of less risk. Have a scan at 20 weeks with expert hands for any anomaly.
I hope things would be better.

"Hello doctor,
I am a 22-year-old female. I had my periods on the 2nd of this month. I had unprotected sex on the 10th and took a tablet of Unwanted 72 within an hour of having sex. After five days of taking the tablet, I experienced spotting for two days and very light bleeding on the third day. I have not had my periods since then. What are my chances of getting pregnant? If I am not pregnant, when should I expect my periods? Should I count my cycle from 2nd or 15th, that is, the date when I experienced light bleeding due to pill? Also, could the bleeding that I experienced be implantation bleeding since it was too less? I also took a home pregnancy test on 21st that gave a negative result but I am not sure if I can rely on it. Should I take another pregnancy test?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
The Unwanted 72 has a success rate of 99 , so the withdrawal bleed that you experienced on the 15th is more likely to be a pill withdrawal rather than an implantation bleed. Another reason being you were on day 9 of your cycle during your act of sexual intimacy which was within your safe period, presuming that you have regular cycles. However, you may get a serum beta hCG test done to rule out pregnancy if in doubt conclusively. If the hCG levels are less than 3 mIU, then you are surely not pregnant.
If not pregnant, then your next menses shall be by 20 to 21st of the following month or late by a week to 10 days considering the 15th as your fresh LMP. There can be a delay of seven to 10 days, as it is a known side effect of Unwanted-72 and can be seen for one to two cycles.

"Hello doctor,
I am considering pursuing a second opinion about some palpable lymph nodes that have been present in my neck for approximately six months now. There is a total of eight of them, present on both sides of the neck. These are all cervical lymph nodes, with the exception of one, which is submental. I have seen my physician about this, and subsequently an ENT. I have had ultrasounds of the nodes done on two separate occasions over a period of two months, as well as two CBCs to check for anything in the blood. Thus far, everything has come back normal. The first report reads palpable foci correspond to normal-appearing lymph nodes. The second report reads Palpable areas of concern all correspond to benign-appearing lymph nodes. No pathologically enlarged nodes are seen. None of the lymph nodes are larger than 0.27 inches. So, technically they are not enlarged, and bloodwork is normal. Therefore, my doctors have told me I do not need to worry about anything like lymphoma for now, and that a biopsy is not necessary. However, my concerns are that, even though the lymph nodes have not changed much over the last six months, none of the nodes have gone away at all. And, I have received no explanation for the cause of the palpable nodes. Secondly, I have been using Humira to treat my Crohns disease, which I am aware carries an increased risk for lymphoma. I have not had any other significant symptoms like fever, weight loss, or night sweats.Therefore, my question is, should I push harder to get a biopsy of the most prominent lymph node to rule out lymphoma for sure? And, should I seek a second opinion about all of this? I just cannot put my mind at ease, and I feel as though my concerns are being dismissed after the examinations, ultrasounds, and blood tests. Please let me know if you have any thoughts or suggestions.","Hello,

Welcome to icliniq.com.
As your last menses was 27th of last month, now you are 3 days late for your menses here. But, as you had sex for the first time, there is all likelihood, that hormonal changes and readjustment of progesterone levels do take place and menses may get delayed. Considering that the sex was unprotected, though coitus interruptus withdrawal method, still there may be a chance of pregnancy due to precum over the penile tip. The best  time to confirm or rule out pregnancy with a urine pregnancy test would  be eight days post missed periods, so you have 5 days to go. If you want to get a conclusive result as of today, then you may opt for a serum beta hCG test human chorionic gonadotropin. If the blood hCG levels are less than 5 ngdL, then you are surely not pregnant and your symptoms are likely to be PMS premenstrual syndrome.

Welcome to icliniq.com. Your question is valid. There are many neurological conditions that can present with PE premature ejaculation. Ejaculation is actually a reflex being controlled at spinal level. So, disease like multiple sclerosis, which affects the white areas of cord and spinal cord injuries can present with PE. Penile hypersensitivity can also lead to PE. You can use condoms to reduce penile sensitivity. But, as you said you have no other symptoms, so I do not think your PE is neurological. The most common cause is anxiety and PE is quite common in type A personalities, those who are always on toes. If you want to contact a specialist for this, then please contact an andrologist. If the serum testosterone levels are normal for you and you do not have any other neurological symptoms, thenyour PE is mostly because of autonomic system imbalance, which can be very well corrected by meditation, but that may take a while to work. Meanwhile, I suggest tablet Tramadol approximately 2 hours before sex, which delays ejaculation.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Facial warts occur due to HPV human papilloma virus and some people are more susceptible to it due to some complex immunological parameters. They are too notorious to recur and avoid shaving for some time. Also, the probable treatment is electrocautery. Going to the swimming pool will not affect their behavior as you are already infected.

I suggest you take a tablet of Ascazin Zinc three times daily for eight weeks. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her, and take the medicine with their consent.

"Hi doctor,I am a 31-year-old female, and I have bleeding between my periods. My usual bleeding cycle is 34 days. I have one son. I got a C-section seven years ago. For the past four months, I have been getting a mild little dark than usual, bleeding exactly on the 13 to 15th day after my period. It is just one time bleed mixed with white discharge on the 13th day. Again one-time blood mixed with white on the 15th day after my period. This bleeding is not throughout the day. Each time not enough to use pads. It is a very small amount. It is a little darker in color. After this, I get the same bleeding for one day that week before my actual period. I did not feel any discomfort during my five-day period. It is very normal. There is no pain or cramps, and do not have a heavy flow. This has been happening to me for the past four months, and now this month, I have felt mild injection-like sharp pain three times in ten days in the lower abdomen, exactly lower one inch right near my belly button, and pain is traveling to the top vaginal area which is two or three inches down.I am seriously worried about this issue. Please help.Thanks.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern. This is mostly ovulation bleeding, which happens in some females and is entirely normal. Pain has many causes, and get an ultrasound scan and let me know. Till then, you can take the Meftal-Spas tablet twice after a meal for three days. If the pain subsides, you can discontinue early also.

"Hi doctor,
I am a 24-year-old female. I took thyroid medicine 25 mcg around two years back, but since my tests were all in the specified range and I felt better good diet and exercise were helping, I stopped taking medicine. I am currently experiencing fatigue, leg muscle weakness, high heart rate 110 bpm to 120 bpm usually, and often reaches 130 bpm to 135 bpm. I have been monitoring for some days due to corona. I have dehydrated skin in my palms, high sweating, and an irritated throat. I got my thyroid profile test, and the results are T3- 0.86 ngdL, T4- 5.21 mcgdL, TSH- 32.84 mIUL. Is there something to worry about? I may have had corona during this time, but I did not show any symptoms since my family members had tested positive, I took antibiotics Azithromycin, Ivermectin. Do I need medication, or will this improve with a good diet and exercise? I could not exercise and keep up with a good diet in this lockdown for several months. I am currently taking Montair LC for a week for the irritated throat, Vitamin A to Z tablets for a week improvement in skin and palm dryness after three to four days, Vitamin C, Vitamin D3, and Zinc tablets for three days as my family members tested positive for corona.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have gone through your query. The laboratory results are pretty evident. And all your symptoms point towards symptomatic hypothyroidism. Fatigue, weakness, and dry skin are common symptoms of hypothyroidism. In this case, I would advise you to restart your thyroid medication. We would need to start with a higher dose to get the symptoms in control. Based on your weight, a dose of 75 mcg would be adequate. If TSH thyroid-stimulating hormone levels had been below 10 mIUmL, I would have advised diet and exercise, but more than 10 mIUmL levels are difficult to control with diet. Also, I would suggest you start thyroid medication at the above dose and repeat tests after a month. I would suggest you start on Iron tablets as hypothyroidism usually leads to heavy periods and then anemia. I would be happy to help you further if you have any more questions. We can have a follow-up after a month to see if we can modify your dosages accordingly.

Newborn babies pass motion every two to five days and can go up to one week. If you are feeding well, then there is no need to worry. However, the abdomen will look full, and the gas will be smelly.

I am sorry for your loss. It is common to develop severe anxiety and depression after any significant loss in life. Prolonged grief results in the development of depression. Please try to keep yourself busy. Spend time outdoors with your son, which will help reduce the trauma. For persistent depression and anxiety, medicines like SSRIs selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors can be used.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
This is unusual in two aspects. Forcible manipulation like this is not recommended. If needed, this should be done by a doctor with an anesthetic. Secondly, the knee should never undergo such manipulation as there should have been some range to begin. Did the knee swell up when the physiotherapist manipulated it? Did you hear any obvious sound? Finally, check with your surgeon about this, and normally, deep knee bends are not allowed for six weeks after a meniscal repair, but following this range of motion, exercises are allowed.

"Hello doctor,
I had a UTI two years ago that went untreated which resulted in the problem. I now have a permanent red dot on the head of my penis. No pain, bump or itching has ever come from the said dot. It has not increased in size in over a year. I have been using Kermatazole on the penis head for over a year now when the redness gets brighter. I take comprehensive STD tests every four months. The readings are always the same and the results negative. Now, I am worried that I have tested as an early case of herpes II simplex genital herpes. I have performed two HSV2 IGG quant tests this year. Four months ago, I tested with a reading of 0.076. This month, I tested with a reading of 0.232. I had several different sexual partners during this period with unprotected contact, but no unprotected penetration, including two days before the most recent test. Should I be worried I contracted genital herpes?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand that you are greatly concerned about having early genital herpes. Both of your HSV IgG tests are negative since their values are less than 0.9. More accurate tests to determine primary HSV herpes simplex virus infection include HSV culture and HSV polymerase chain reaction PCR assays. However, the description of your penile lesion does not seem to be consistent with genital herpes. Genital herpes usually manifests with multiple painful ulcers or fluid-filled vesicles. Given your description, the lesion seems to be vascular, or a collection of small blood vessels. This is particularly true if there is blanching or there is a decrease in redness if you press on it. If the lesion increases in size, or if there are other associated symptoms such as enlarging lymph nodes in the groin, weight loss, or fever, it is better to have it biopsied, to make sure that it is not cancer.

"Hi doctor,
What is the possibility of rabies if a 2-month-old unvaccinated dog that bit me dies of parvovirus infection within a week after the bite?
My 2-month-old pup bit me by mistake while playing with other puppies. After two days, I found my dog sick, often vomiting, and it was not eating. I took my dog to the veterinarian, who concluded that it was parvovirus. Soon he started becoming sicker and sicker with bloody stools, more vomit, etc., and died in four days after becoming ill and seven days after biting me. I had my concerns about rabies, so I took the dead dog to check for rabies, but the veterinarian refused to say because there were no rabies symptoms, and they could not waste resources. He bit my palm close to my wrist, and it was just a minor wound that healed within two days. There is no pain in that area or any discomfort. But just because a dog that bit me died, I am paranoid about getting rabies.
Kindly help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have read your concern in detail and will surely help you out.
The chances of you acquiring rabies are impossible. I will state the reasons.
1. The dog was your pet. Pet dogs rarely acquire rabies if they have been exposed to rabid dogs.
2. It has been more than seven days. If you had rabies, you would have started showing symptoms by now.
3. I agree with your veterinarian that your puppys symptoms do not correlate much to rabies but parvovirus infection.
4. Your bite and the wound were only minor. The chances of transfer of rabies virus in a minor wound are 0.01.
I guess these are more than sufficient reasons to believe you are safe. Do not worry, relax you are going to be fine.
If you have any more doubts, feel free to contact me anytime.

"Hello doctor,
I am married it has been one and a half year of my marriage. It was an arranged marriage, so we took the time to understand each other before making love we took five months, and we did not do it. But after five months period, he tried for one year and could not make it. He can only ejaculate for some seconds. Is this because after marriage we took five months and so he is not able to make it now?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
It is not because of the five-month gap. He might be suffering from premature ejaculation disorder. Why did you wait for five months? Does your husband have any bad previous sexual experience? If he had a failed sexual intercourse, he will try to avoid it, because he thinks it is going to be a failure again. And he woulod be afraid of getting humiliated infront of you. So he thinks it is better not to have sex.
On management part, first try to relax him, and make him understand that you love him even without sex. Now start working on a treatment.
1. SSRI selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants and Clomipramine.
2. Anesthetic spray on glans penis before sex only a few studies support it.
3. Weak pelvic floor muscles sometimes contribute to it. Kegel exercises may help strengthen them. Wear a condom as it may desensitize him. Some men find that masturbating a few hours before sex helps them stay in control during intercourse.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 84, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 7}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"

Welcome to icliniq.com.
It seems your doctor is trying to control acute attacks of asthma which is right.
I suggest the following
Focus on controlling attacks by avoiding stimulators like dust, sudden exposure to hot and cold weather, keep away from pets. Educate your son about the same so that your son takes precautionary steps.
Build his immunity by giving special vaccinations and a high protein diet.
Vitamin D, vitamin C, and Omega-3 supplements will help to reduce attacks.
If asthmatic attacks are well controlled, kids usually outgrow the age. I mean, they have a better prognosis.
Any medications that are given to control asthmatic attacks usually require three to six months therapy for better response. Let your doctor decide if it is asthma or not.

"Hi doctor,I have had a history of coughing for a few weeks here and there in spring and fall. It will be fine after about three weeks. Then, my throat will start to itch, and I will begin to have trouble talking. Later, I start coughing explosively. Once I get to the coughing phase, my eyes start watering. It looks like I am crying and I will either cough until I throw up mucus or fluid or vomit if I have just eaten and then I can breathe again. It happens on the bus, at work, and sometimes at night. When I do not have these odd coughing spells, I feel fine. There are no sore throat, vomiting, or GI symptoms. Sometimes I will have the sniffles. I hugged a friend at the dance, and I went from fine to immediate coughing in about 5 to 10 seconds. I will have a few weeks of this, and then it will clear up on its own. Last week, this happened about 10 times, and itchy throat spells where I worked on breathing through it. I am always sucking on throat lozenges during these weeks.My total IgE level taken during one of these symptoms-filled weeks was 0.0736 mgdL, where the reference range is less than 0.0416 mgdL for adults. Medications I was on during testing include Zantac Ranitidine just in case it is acid reflux and Ibuprofen for menstrual cramps. They did a skin test this week to try and start figuring things out, and two types of dust mites and something else came back positive. Spirometry is waiting on the results. I have never been able to run a mile outside without stopping to catch my breath a few times. I got bronchitis a lot as a kid. It seemed like if I got a cold, it would inevitably move to my lungs before getting better. My GP was hesitant to order the total IgE level because she said it was often falsely positive. Would Zantac make IgE or allergy skin tests falsely positive? Is this likely to be allergic asthma? How best should I treat it?","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
At present, you are suffering from allergic rhinitis converting to allergic asthma.
Get your absolute eosinophilic count done and you need to go for spirometry only at the time of the attack to pinpoint the diagnosis. The differential diagnosis includes allergic bronchiolitis.
I suggest you Fexofenadine 180 mg at night and Pantoprazole 40 mg half an hour before breakfast. If eosinophils are raised, then I suggest you Diethylcarbamazine.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have gone through your query and understand your concern.
You have not mentioned if the pain remains in the back or radiates to the leg. Also, is the pain getting relieved by anti-inflammatory tablets, and finally, what makes the pain worse? Vitamin D and B12 deficiency are very common and not directly related to your problem, as you had the deficiency even before you hurt your back. Lack of vitamin D leads to muscle weakness and bone pain, while B12 leads to numbness and tingling. I will suggest that you see a good physiotherapist who can give your posture advice and help strengthen your back. If, at any stage, you get leg pain, then an MRI magnetic resonance imaging will be needed.
Hope this has answered your query.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have gone through your case and I understand your concern. According to your description, this is looking like a urinary tract infection. After being sexually active there is quite a possibility of getting a urinary infection. Burning micturition is not a sign of pregnancy, in your case, there is very less chance of getting pregnant. If you only had sex around your ovulation day which usually occurs around the 14th day of the menstrual cycle, otherwise no chance of getting pregnant. To rule out urinary infection please do a urine routine microscopy test. So we can start proper antibiotics accordingly. Till then have plenty of water, at least three liters per day, and use condoms during intercourse until the infection persists. I hope I have cleared all your doubts.

I have read the query, and I can understand your concern.
Pimple is somewhat hormonal and due to oily skin. Therefore, I suggest the following measures
Do not use hair oil or sticky cream on your face.
Avoid oily food, chocolate, and milk products.
Avoid dust and use sunscreen above 30 SPF sun protection factor.
Do not rub cream on the face.
Do not use any steroid creams.
Continue treatment for at least one month.
Facewash or soap is not a treatment and is not very useful.
Do not touch acne and avoid pressing it.
I suggest the following treatment
Clindamycin Clintop, Faceclin Clindamycin and Nicotinamide, or Clear gel is more preventive and curative. So I suggest using it all over your face in the morning. Acne can be treated at night using Adapalene gel, such as Adalene Adapalene with Clindamycin or Differin. Tablet Doxycycline 100 mg once a day. Consult a specialist doctor, talk to them, and then take the medication.
I hope this will help you.
Thank you.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 80, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,My father is a diabetic and he is taking Metformin for the past six years. In the last month, he did a general and complete blood checkup in which his blood sugar levels were high, and his cholesterol level was 164 mgdL. But he did not have any symptoms concerned with this. Our next appointment is in another two weeks, by then is there something my father should know? How can we change his lifestyle to control his blood sugar and high cholesterol levels?Thank you.","Hi,
Welcome to iclinq.com.
I read your query and understand your concern.
Here are a few lifestyle changes that may help in managing blood sugar levels and cholesterol
Healthy eating Encourage your father to follow a balanced and nutritious diet. Focus on consuming whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Limit the intake of processed foods, sugary drinks, and foods high in saturated and trans fats.
Regular physical activity Engaging in regular exercise can help improve insulin sensitivity and lower blood sugar levels. Encourage your father to incorporate activities such as walking, cycling, swimming, or any other form of exercise he enjoys into his routine. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week, along with strength training exercises.
Weight management Maintaining a healthy weight is important for managing blood sugar and cholesterol levels. If your father is overweight, encourage gradual and sustainable weight loss through a combination of a healthy diet and regular physical activity.
Medication compliance Your fater needs to continue taking his prescribed medications, such as Metformin, as directed by his healthcare provider. If necessary, adjustments to the medication regimen can be made during his next appointment.
Stress management High-stress levels can impact blood sugar levels. Encourage your father to find healthy ways to manage stress, such as practicing relaxation techniques, engaging in hobbies, spending time with loved ones, or seeking professional support if needed.
Regular monitoring Regularly monitoring blood sugar levels at home can provide valuable information about how diet, exercise, and medications are affecting your fathers health. This can help him and his healthcare provider make informed decisions about managing his condition.
Feel free to contact me for further queries.

"Hello doctor,
I had an impacted wisdom tooth removed and another unerupted wisdom tooth removed from the lower jaw. The one on my right healed fine. The other had recurring infections. Finally, the left one was lavaged, and a piece of necrosed tooth fragment came out. Since then, I have felt the site was not healing right. It has been one to two months since that procedure. I have always been able to feel something foreign when I feel with my tongue in the gap behind the tooth. I used a plastic toothpick and extracted something quite big it felt like wax and not like food. Now there is a big void there. Is this normal? Did the surgeons put this foreign object there on purpose? Kindly help.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I read your query and understand your concern.
You are not supposed to touch the extraction site with any foreign objects. The yellow wax thing is the natural blood clot required for proper healing of the wound. Now, most probably, the socket may get infected and result in a dry socket condition.
I suggest you do warm saline gargles twice a day for a week. Then, if there is pain, consult a dentist in person for cleaning and debridement of the wound once again and closure.

"Hi doctor,
Around six months ago, I removed four wisdom teeth one tooth per month. I remember the first two were not very painful, but the third and the fourth ones, especially the fourth, gave me really bad headaches and it even made my whole cheek swell for a few days.
Anyways, I also noticed this one tooth from my lower teeth started moving after all of my wisdom teeth were removed, and so I started putting on my retainers at night, but the problem is that in the morning when I eat, that tooth starts moving again and I get a headache eventually during the day.
My orthodontist told me that there is nothing wrong with my retainers and that this headache could be caused by me grinding my teeth at night. I have also been told to do a CBCT scan.
Any suggestions on what I should do? Should I go back to wearing braces on my lower teeth?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Braces are not good for the time being. Allow the molar tooth to become firm. Get an X-ray done to confirm whether there is any periodontal recession.
The bone support may be very less at the area behind where the wisdom tooth was removed, hence more mobility to front tooth. You may need periodontal surgery along with root canal treatment to make it firm.

"Hi doctor,
I had sexual exposure with a girl five days ago. Her HIV Human Immunodeficiency Virus status is unknown, but she had no symptoms or bumps, and she told me she had more than 20 sexual partners some of whom she had unprotected intercourse with. I engaged in insertive vaginal sex with a condom and received oral sex without a condom. I did not notice any break in the condom, although there were periods of friction. Every time the friction increased, I changed to the new condom. As a precaution, before that night, I was also on on-demand PrEP Pre- exposure Prophylaxis. The day of the encounter was my fifth day of daily PrEP, and I had taken a double dose the day before. In total, I had consumed six PrEP pills before exposure. After exposure, I continued to consume PrEP for three more days two pills the next day, one pill the day after that, and one pill the day after. I stopped the on-demand regime yesterday. Hours after our meeting, I developed leg fatigue and became very anxious. The fatigue persisted only for one day only in my legs. Today I also noticed three red dot rashes on my anterior chest flat and not itchy. I am worried if this is an acute retroviral syndrome rash. So far, no fever or pharyngitis. I plan to take a PCR Polymerase Chain Reaction RNARibonucleic Acid on day ten in five days. How likely is it that I have contracted HIV, and is it likely for ARS rash to be present without fever in just five days?
Thank you.","Hi, Welcome to icliniq.com.
The chances of transmission of HIV human immunodeficiency virus by single-protected intercourse are almost nil if a condom is used in a proper manner. The chances of unprotected oral sex are almost nil unless there are bleeding wounds in the oral cavity. It appears the risk is almost nil. PrEP pre-exposure prophylaxis for additional protection. It reduces the risk even further. She may be HIV negative too. Anyway, you can go for an HIV antibody test now and after 90 days of exposure to be relieved of anxiety totally and conclusive results. HIV 1 and 2 RNA PCR real-time polymerase chain reaction tests can be taken after 12 to 14 days of exposure if you are too anxious. The rash is unlikely due to HIV. It may be minor changes due to weather or irritation, or dryness. It may resolve on its own. Consult your doctor for an examination if it persists.

Based on your symptoms, you may have developed a threatened abortion from vaginal spotting, which may be due to the anterior fundamental position of the uterine fibroid, and this may lead to worsened bleeding and the final termination of pregnancy spontaneously.

Searching for symptoms will make you anxious. In most circumstances, PVCs premature ventricular contractions are not dangerous. In healthy people, a few hundred PVCs are usual. Anxiety, excessive coffee, and some medications all enhance PVCs. There are a few elements to consider when determining if PVCs are harmful. Please tell me the following.

"Hello doctor,I am a 33-year-old and weigh about 189 pounds. My whole body hurts. I got pain all over the body, pain in the legs and hands.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Well, I have gone through your history and the reports attached.attachment removed to protect patient identity. All the reports are normal. I could not find the reports of liver function tests there, but I suppose your doctor had already looked into it. Do not worry, you dont have any cancers at the current time. If any cancer would cause pain, it surely would have affected your blood counts as well. As for the Rheumatoid factor, 8 or 11, can be lab variation or instrument variation, but as long as you do not have joint swellings or pain it is insignificant. My diagnosis for pain would go for fibromyalgia. It is more of a diagnosis of exclusion and one only considers it after ruling out the other causes, which they have done so far. I will give you a link, you can go through it and let me know if your symptoms match this. As treatment will depend on your being convinced about the diagnosis.

"Hi doctor,
I am writing to discuss a concerning issue related to my sexual health that has been bothering me. Approximately a week ago, I engaged in sexual activity with my partner, during which we had intercourse multiple times. I ejaculated each time. However, I am now experiencing difficulty achieving a full erection. Over the course of the week, I have met with my partner on several occasions and attempted different activities, including role-playing, but I have been unable to achieve a complete and satisfactory erection. Although I received oral stimulation from my partner, my erection did not reach its maximum potential. Additionally, I have noticed a decrease in my libido and overall arousal. I am unsure whether this is indicative of low testosterone levels, erectile dysfunction, or if it is simply a result of the intense sexual activity I engaged in previously, and my reproductive system requires time to recover.
I would greatly appreciate your professional insights and advice regarding this matter.
Kindly help.
Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I read your query and can understand your concern.
Based on the information provided, it appears that the issue you are experiencing is likely related to psychological factors rather than low testosterone levels or any specific medical condition such as erectile dysfunction ED. It is not uncommon for having occasional difficulties with achieving or maintaining an erection to occur without a specific cause.
In such cases, it is important to understand that the unconscious stress and anticipation of future difficulties can contribute to further loss of libido and performance anxiety during sexual encounters. To address this, it is recommended to take a relaxed approach and avoid putting pressure on yourself. Taking a break from sexual activity for a few days can also help reduce anxiety. It is important to communicate openly with your partner about your concerns and ensure a supportive and understanding environment.
Remember that psychological factors can have a significant impact on sexual performance, and by remaining relaxed and not anticipating any difficulties, you can help alleviate stress and improve the overall experience. If the issue persists or causes significant distress, it may be beneficial to consult with a healthcare professional who specializes in sexual health for further guidance and support.

I can understand your concern. According to your statement, you have been suffering from increased frequency of menstrual periods with prolonged period symptoms like cramping, constipation, getting pimples, headaches, etc.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Thank you for your query.
I understand your concern. The condition you have of grinding teeth at night is called bruxism. This will have bad effects on teeth as it will cause polished facets over the occlusal surface of teeth due to loss or grinding of hard structures of teeth and can also cause muscular pain and TMJ temporomandibular joint pain. You can use a night guard, but since you have braces, it is better to use a customized one that might require changing from time to time due to your tooth movements caused by braces treatment.

I saw the attached pictures attachment removed to protect patient identity. Oral sex has the least possibility of ARS acute retroviral syndrome. I do not think you have ARS. Do you have dandruff or an earache or a toothache? Do you have a history of a cold or a cough? If the rashes appeared after six weeks of oral sex, then get CMIA fourth generation test done. It can be HSV herpes simplex virus or any other sexually transmitted disease. I suggest you consult a skin specialist or a  venereologist. The other possibilities are more rather than HIV infection. At present, for the rash, I suggest you try the following Tablet Atarax Hydroxyzine 25 mg, one at night for 10 days. Ointment Betnesol-N Neomycin and Betamethasone, locally two or three times a day. Fluconazole powder, to sprinkle over ointment. For the enlarged lymph node, I suggest you try taking the following Tablet Amoxiclav Amoxycillin and Clavulanic acid 625 mg, two times a day after lunch and dinner for five to seven days. Tablet Signoflam Aceclofenac, Paracetamol, and Serratiopeptidase, two times a day after lunch and dinner for three to five days.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Stammering has got a multiple etiology and pathogenesis. A hereditary component in this has been extensively studied. A recent study was done including 12 children, and five generations of the family were investigated.
The hereditary component is not the only thing that is important. There are other factors related to environmental like the way children are brought up, the circumstances the child faces, etc., which will decide this.
Chances of the hereditary component are variable accordingly to different studies. It differs with the genetic component of mother and father if both are having this chances of around 25 according to some studies.
If only one parent is having, then chances are still less. Also, the mode of inheritance is also not clearly identified. There is a significant limitation in the available literature on these studies.
My final opinion is the chances are less if the child is brought up in a healthy environment and family with a proper speech there from childhood. It should never be a cause to stop marrying I suppose.","{'score': 92, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

Two years ago, I underwent a hysterectomy for adenomyosis, so I have been considering if there might be a related connection. I am currently using HRT hormone replacement therapy gel and taking Ibuprofen for pain.Thank you.","Hello,Welcome to icliniq.com.I am sorry to hear about your blood reports. Your blood test results indicate two main concerns an abnormal chemistry test suggesting acute kidney injury AKI and a full blood count that is borderline. Let us discuss what this might mean for your health and what steps should be taken next.Acute kidney injury AKI warning stage Acute kidney injury is a condition where your kidneys suddenly are unable to filter waste products from your blood. When this occurs, dangerous levels of waste may accumulate, and your bloods chemical makeup may get out of balance. The warning stage suggests that your kidney function has declined rapidly, which could be due to various factors such as dehydration, certain medications, an obstruction in your urinary tract, or an underlying illness.Borderline full blood count A full blood count FBC measures the concentration of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. A borderline result indicates that one or more of the measured components are at the lower or higher edge of the normal range. This could be due to a range of conditions, from mild infections to more serious blood disorders. Given these findings, it is important to take the following stepsFurther evaluation Additional tests may be necessary to determine the cause of the AKI and the specifics of the borderline full blood count. This might include urine tests to check for signs of kidney damage or infection, imaging studies such as ultrasound to view the kidneys, and possibly a kidney biopsy if the cause of the injury is not clear.Review medications and supplements Some substances can harm the kidneys, especially if taken in large amounts or your kidneys are not functioning well. Provide a list of all medications, supplements, and over-the-counter drugs you take to your healthcare provider.Hydration and diet Ensure you are well-hydrated, as dehydration can contribute to AKI. Depending on the cause and severity of the kidney injury, you may need to modify your diet, such as reducing salt, protein, and potassium intake.Monitor and manage blood pressure High blood pressure can be both a cause and a consequence of kidney damage. Keeping it under control is crucial.Avoid nephrotoxic agents Certain substances can further damage the kidneys, such as NSAIDs nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, for example, Ibuprofen, some antibiotics, and contrast dyes used in imaging tests.Address underlying conditions If the AKI is due to another condition, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, it is crucial to manage these effectively.Regular monitoring Follow-up blood tests will be necessary to monitor your kidney function and full blood count.Consult a specialist Depending on the severity of the AKI and the full blood count results, you may need to see a nephrologist a kidney specialist or a hematologist a blood specialist. It is important to address these results promptly with your healthcare provider, who can provide a more specific treatment plan based on the full context of your health and the detailed results of your tests.Thanks for using icliniq, and have a nice day.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

"Hi doctor,
I have irregular period, and I get my period once in six months. I am trying to get pregnant for a year. After having sex last night, I started bleeding.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
You have had irregular cycles, with a frequency of once in six months. In that case, there is all likelihood that you are experiencing hormonal imbalances and needs to rule out hypothyroidism, hyperprolactinemia, and definitely polycystic ovarian syndrome. This can be done with a hormonal profile and an ultrasound pelvis examination. Secondly, if you have been experiencing post-coital bleeding or vaginal bleeding  after sex and if it is not your menses, then there are chances that you may be suffering from cervical erosions or cervicitis, which can bleed post intercourse. You shall need a  speculum examination and a Pap Papanicolaou test smear by your gynecologist to confirm that. These can be treated with antibiotics for 15 days and abstinence for three weeks at least. Again, if you have been trying to get pregnant and if we assume that this is your menses, then get a hormonal profile  FSH follicle-stimulating hormone, LH Luteinizing hormone, AMH anti-mullerian hormone, serum testosterone, serum estradiol, thyroid profile, serum prolactin levels done along with an ultrasound pelvis to check for astral follicle count and also the endometrial thickness and polycystic ovaries. Please follow-up with reports. We can go ahead from there after viewing the reports.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 87, 'clinical_accuracy': 19, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"

During teenage, it is very common to get acne, especially on cheeks and forehead due to several reasons primarily because of hormonal changes in puberty. It is advisable to wash your face multiple times to avoid the accumulation of dirt, which can lead to blockage of pores, and that results in acne formation. Use of a mild medicated facewash suggested by your dermatologist might help you to get rid of the present symptoms.

"Hello doctor,I ate dry cement from the wall. I will not eat it again as I know it is harmful. But how should I stop it from reacting or causing any harm to my body? Should I take any medicine? I am scared it would cause blockage or anything.Kindly help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com
Thank you for your query.
Eating dry cement is dangerous and can cause severe health problems. It is crucial to seek immediate medical attention, as the cement may cause damage to your digestive system, leading to blockages or other complications.
Call emergency services or visit the nearest hospital Inform the healthcare professionals about what happened, and they will assess your condition and provide appropriate treatment.
Induce vomiting Try to induce vomiting to expel as much cement as possible. However, do not induce vomiting if you experience difficulty breathing, convulsions, or loss of consciousness.
Drink water Drink small sips of water to help dilute the cement in your stomach and facilitate its passage through your digestive system.
Medical treatment The healthcare professionals will likely administer activated charcoal, which can bind to the cement and help prevent its absorption into your bloodstream. They may also perform an endoscopy to remove any remaining cement from your digestive tract.
Monitor your symptoms Keep an eye on any symptoms, such as abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting, and report any changes to your healthcare provider.
Follow-up care Depending on the severity of your ingestion, you may need additional tests or treatments to ensure there are no long-term complications.
It is essential to understand that consuming hazardous substances can be life-threatening and should be avoided at all costs. If you find yourself in a situation where you are tempted to ingest non-food items, seek support from friends, family, or a mental health professional to address the underlying issues.
I hope this helps you.

"Hello doctor,
I am a 75-year-old male. I had IHD 40 years back. 23 years back, my doctor asked me to add Ismo 10 mg twice a day. Since then, I am taking it twice a day uninterruptedly. Then I was 54 years old. My BP has always been normal in all these years. Maybe 15080 mmHg or 14090 mmHg till a few years back. Now it is in normal level say 12080 mmHg, 12073 mmHg, 11570 mmHg, etc. Since a year, I am experiencing low blood pressure at times, giving me vertigo-like dizziness for 1 hour or 2 only in the early mornings and when I take Vertin, it subsides after 1 or 2 hours. Recently, I went to a well-known cardiologist in my area. He checked me and said that I have systemic hypertension and I need not take Ismo any longer as I do not need it. The BP at that time was 13070. Before my going to the above cardiologist also I have experienced these levels like 12070 mmHg, 11069 mmHg, 12575 mmHg likewise. He further said after stoppage of Ismo, the BP levels come to normal levels and I will not experience dizziness anymore. But, I am afraid of stopping the Ismo abruptly for fear of getting an anginal attack, which I have never experienced. I am afraid whether to ask my doctor about this. So, I have stopped taking one dose of Ismo 10 mg during the night. Slowly I shall stop the other doses also in due course. Kindly give me your valuable advice about Ismo, about stopping Ismo and dizziness. Is there any harm if I stop one dose? Does long usage of Ismo trigger low blood pressure and vertigo? Please enlighten me on this subject.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Firstly, Ismo Isosorbide Mononitrate is given for angina or chest pain. If one is not having it without Ismo then it may be stopped. So it is not an absolutely necessary medicine in absence of angina. Next thing, it can cause low BP, blood pressure leading to dizziness. But, you mentioned, the lowest BP recorded was 110 systolic, and it is not too low to cause dizziness usually. Have you checked your BP while you being dizzy? Next thing, you said the response to Vertin Betahistine, which is not likely in Ismo or hypotension induced dizziness. Vertin is for vertigo induced from the internal ear which is a very common problem. Also, importantly. dizziness induced by hypotension or Ismo will occur on standing or walking, but not while lying down or resting. So if it occurs on lying down as well or on neck movements then it is likely from the internal ear. Next, you should get one echocardiogram done to rule out the decrease in heart function as BP is remaining on the lower side. So overall, just go through the above description, and try to decide whether it is Ismo induced or from the internal ear, and you may stop Ismo as advised by the local cardiologist. Also, echocardiogram is necessary.","{'score': 91, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 91, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}"

Can you help me understand the distinctions between these conditions, and how they may manifest in middle-aged women? Additionally, what are the potential treatments or management strategies for addressing these symptoms?
Please help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I went through your query.
The middle age is I would say a golden era in the life of a woman because this is the time when the reproductive system has reached its peak and the decline will occur but if this decline is supported by certain lifestyle changes it will lead to happy menopause leading you to have least effects of menopausal symptoms like hot blushes. So, I suggest you follow a few lifestyle changes.
1. Have an active lifestyle with one hour of exercise or yoga.
2. Eat fruits and vegetables in moderation with stress on iron-rich foods like green leafy vegetables.
3. Have more of a fiber-rich diet to keep your gut cool and avoid constipation. You can have jaggery which gives fiber and iron both in winter.
4. Hormonal balance can be maintained through regular checkups by a pap smear, ultrasound, and self-breast examination.
5. Late-onset hypothyroidism is a concept of ovarian failure that is more theoretical because many stages had to be crossed before that.
Hope it helps.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
The rule of thumb in psychiatry is to prescribe medicine for an adequate duration and adequate dose, before considering it ineffective or plan to change. If your doctor has previously tried one medication for proper dose and duration now, he can add another drug, so it depends on how you are responding to medicine? So it might be possible that if you did not respond to one medicine your doctor keeps adding medicine to your prescription. If you are not in a depression or not a rapid cycler, Sertraline can be tapered down. If you are in remission, Lamotrigine can be slowly stopped. I found no counteracting drug.

Thank you.","Hi,
I appreciate you signing up on icliniq.com.
You now have exclusive access to expert medical opinions.
I am sorry to hear that you are experiencing discomfort. Itching and swelling in the vaginal area can be caused by various factors, like infections, allergies, or irritation. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional to get an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. In the meantime, you may try some general tips for relief
1. Keep the area clean and dry Gently wash the area with mild, unscented soap and water. Avoid using harsh soaps, douches, or feminine hygiene products that may further irritate the area. Pat the area dry after washing.
2. Avoid potential irritants Perfumed soaps, detergents, fabric softeners, and other irritants can aggravate the symptoms. Try using hypoallergenic, fragrance-free products and wearing breathable cotton underwear.
3. Avoid scratching Although it may be tempting, scratching can further irritate the area and potentially lead to infection. If needed, apply a cold compress or use over-the-counter anti-itch creams or ointments specifically formulated for the genital area.
4. Avoid sexual activity It is advisable to abstain from sexual activity until you can consult with a healthcare professional.

"Hello doctor,
I had recently undergone dental treatment like fillings, deep cleaning, etc., for which I had to keep my mouth open for a long time. Now I have jaw tenderness and blisters on my gums and on the part of the mouth where the dentist was working. Is this normal? Kindly help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern.
Do you have any known allergies? Any history of previous dental treatment? Jaw tenderness could be from the extensive dental treatment and long-time mouth opening. If it hurts a lot, over-the-counter painkillers like the tablet Paracetamol will help to control pain. On the other hand, the blisters could be due to traumatic ulcers caused during treatment, an allergy to any of the dental materials used, or the latex in the dentists gloves, which is common.
I would suggest getting back to the dentist and examining your multiple ulcers to know what caused them.
Meanwhile, I would suggest,
1. Avoid hot and spicy foods.
2. Do warm saline mouth rinses thrice daily.
3. Rinse your mouth after every meal.
4. Drink plenty of water and keep yourself hydrated.
Maintaining good oral hygiene and following the above-said instructions will prevent further infection of the ulcer and promotes faster healing. If required, if it hurts, a topical anesthetic like Orajel Benzocaine can be applied over the ulcer with a clean finger.
I hope this helps.

If the infections are ruled out, then chronic pain can occur due to a condition called endometriosis. You can have severe pain during periods.

Maybe I could use some advice and enlightenment from this online medical panel so that I will not get too worried before going to the hospital for a physical checkup.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I fully understand your concern and will surely help you. I have gone through the details and image attachment removed to protect the patients recovery. Let me explain to you that for getting pregnant, the sperms have to be ejaculated inside the vagina of the female. These sperms then need to fertilize an egg, and the fertilized egg is then required to be implanted in the uterus of the female. When all this happens successfully, then a female is said to be pregnant. In your case, since the intercourse was protected, there is no likelihood of pregnancy. In addition, you have taken the emergency contraceptive pill, so there is no chance. See, the emergency contraceptive pills are hormone-based, and they work in different phases. Firstly they prevent the release of eggs from the ovary. Secondly, if the egg is already released, it prevents fertilization of the egg by making the fluid thick, thus causing difficulty for the sperm to swim, thirdly. If the egg was already fertilized, it prevents the implantation of the egg in the uterus lining. All this leads to some mild spotting or bleeding in certain females, which indicates the clearing of the uterus lining. The color of the spotting can vary from brown to bright red. Do not worry and take a rest. You may also see a delay in your next period as these pills interfere with certain females menstrual patterns.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 95, 'clinical_accuracy': 19, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}"
"Hello doctor,
I have an 11-month-old baby who weighs 10.7 kg and is 78 cm. He has never had any health issues. Today, he started coughing productively, out of the blue. A little in the morning and evening and more in the night. There is a lot of mucus breaking when he coughs, I can hear it. No fever, no other symptoms of a cold. He ate and drank normally and was reasonably active though a bit slower than usual, then I put him to bed. He now wakes up from time to time, coughing productively and crying, then goes back to sleep. I do not see any mucus but I can only hear it. He had a cold seven months ago with a runny nose and a red throat that went to his chest eventually and had a similar productive cough though less heavy than this one. My husband is currently sick with a common cold which started recently. Despite him wearing a mask when around the baby, it is not impossible that the baby was exposed to it. My question is, is this an emergency? Do I need to wake the baby up and take him to the ER? I already have an appointment with his doctor tomorrow morning. Can this be a common cold with just the chest involvement and no other symptoms like a runny nose? Or can it be pneumonia or something really bad, as long as there is no fever, just the rich, wet cough? Basically, can it wait until tomorrow, or is the baby in danger?

No, it is not an emergency as long as the child is not breathless or has difficulty in feeding, or is cyanosed. Also, a detailed investigative workup with blood tests and an X-ray of the chest is advisable to get to the diagnosis. As per your history, I do not think we will find any infectious cause in the reports. In your case, I feel the baby might have aspirated on milk or may have had reflux which is causing this problem.

"Hello doctor,
I have been suffering from anxiety, panic disorder, and perhaps OCD as well but I have not been diagnosed with that yet since I was 11. However, I had been completely anxiety-free for about four or five years until three months back, when I got a horrible panic attack that started it all. Technically, I had some weed muffins last year, and I got a panic attack from which it took me over a week to recover, but I was fine again afterward. Anyway, first I was obsessively worried about my physical health, but that has now shifted to mental health. I have also been suffering from derealization on and off. Anyway, just a couple of days I got this horrible intrusive thought like what if I got psychotic and heard voices that would tell me to hurt my family or my dog or myself note that I love my family, I love my dog, I love myself, and I hate and despise violence of any kind. I have never acted violently in my life and basically, since then, I have been feeling worse and worse. I read a lot about schizophrenia, mainly real life stories and experience of people, which at first made me go okay, now I certainly do not have this, but as time progressed, I started getting more and more intrusive thoughts. Like what if I start being paranoid, what if I start believing that the posters in my room are real people, etc. Occasionally, I ask myself what if these people are not real, what if I am not real? I have also had a blank mind, pretty much unable to think of anything else, since I got this bad last week. I get this constant picture of myself, confined to the bed and crying somewhere in a white room, all by myself. I have also been feeling this kind of gut-fear since then. On the outside, with other people, I behave normally, much kinder, actually, I think. I am a bit slower and find it a bit harder to concentrate on two things at once, which had never been a problem before, but that could as well be due to anxiety. Anyway, my question is, could this be indicative of actual psychosis or prodromal stage of schizophrenia? Or is it more likely just anxiety and OCD? Thank you very much for your response.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
From your description, it appears to be ruminations. Following differentials are likely Health anxiety disorder, hypochondriasis, OCD obsessive compulsive disorder. It is unlikely to be psychosis, as you are well aware of the absurdity of these thoughts. But a confirmed diagnosis can only be made after a detailed evaluation. So kindly consult a psychiatrist in person for detailed evaluation and treatment. Get your thyroid profile done. Besides, patterned breathing exercises like Sudarshan kriya can be helpful, as they ease out anxiety and help you relax and focus. Avoid caffeine and substance use. Remember every problem has a solution you just need to try solving it and help is just a step away. Feel free to ask if you have any further queries.

"Hello doctor,
I have had chronic bloating, indigestion, stomach pain, nausea, and diarrhea for over a month. During that same time, I developed frequent shortness of breath and palpitations with exertion upon waking and after eating. Also, during the same time, I began having severe pain in my fingertips, toes, and elbows that come and go. I just feel very sick. Any idea what this could be? My father had polycythemia vera. My physician assistant did some bloodwork. Monocytes were 10.9, creatinine was 1.6, BUN was 20, and total protein was 8.5. Please provide your opinion.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Based on your query, my opinion is as follows
The serum protein and creatinine levels are a bit high possibly due to increased protein intake or associated dehydration in recent times. Monocytes are mildly elevated and BUN blood urea nitrogen levels are in the upper normal range. Monocytes may indicate ongoing chronic inflammation. It is only mildly elevated and does not have much significance.
For polycythemia vera, hemoglobin levels or hematocrit levels are important. If they are normal, then there is nothing to worry. If the pain is in the fingertips and toes and if there is any associated tingling or burning sensation, we can think of peripheral neuropathy. Vitamin B12 and folic acid supplements should be beneficial. Looking at other symptoms like chronic bloating, indigestion, stomach pain, nausea, and diarrhea, gastritis, increased acidity in the stomach is a possibility.
You need to use antacids along with proton pump inhibitors like Pantoprazole to reduce the acidity. You also need to reduce stress, avoid spicy foods, and take regular meals.
There are no symptoms of polycythemia vera and more in relation to gastritis. If not checked, check once for hemoglobin levels. Maintain good hydration with at least six to eight liters of water per day.

"Hello doctor,
My husband has an advanced stage liver cirrhosis and gets muscle cramps in legs from time to time, at night time or when he wakes up in the morning. Other patients with similar issues recommend drinking tonic water that contains Quinine or taking Calcium Magnesium supplements. He has very low platelet count so is not Quinine dangerous for him? What supplement will you recommend against muscle cramps and in what quantities? Currently, I am taking Propranolol 40 mg and Omeprazole 40 mg daily.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Cramps happen in cirrhotics due to nutritional insufficiency, mineral deficiency, mainly calcium and magnesium. My suggestions would be
Calcerol sachet Vitamin D3 60000 once weekly for six weeks.
Tablet Magnical Magnesium with Calcium twice daily for a month to be taken with food.
Have a high protein diet.
Hepapro powder liver-specific protein powder two scoops three times a day.
Tablet Zincovit carbohydrate, Biotin, Copper, etc. once daily for a month.
The brands vary from place to place. But vitamin and mineral supplements are a must. Do consider this and update if any issues or concerns.

"Hello doctor,
I have high canine teeth due to crowding in my upper jaw. Visually, it appears that space, where my canines should be, is too small for them. However, when I went to an orthodontist, she said that I would need to get my first premolars removed to make room. If I get my wisdom teeth out, should not there be enough room to bring my canines down? I guess it would make a much faster process with braces. Thank you.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Generally, when space is less for the number and size of teeth present in the jaw, it is advised to remove premolar on each side in one or both the jaws. The reason being, it is more convenient to move the front teeth smaller into the space than to push all the back teeth large molar into the space created by removed wisdom teeth. At times there is no space for wisdom teeth to erupt. and at that point our option of removing wisdom teeth for this purpose will not work. Also, it takes a lot longer in terms of time and effort to push the molars back to create space. Another conditional factor is your growth pattern and requirement of taking the front teeth back. In 95 cases, it is favorable to remove premolars than to think of using wisdom tooth space.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 80, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"

"Hello doctor,I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression because of work-related issues two years ago. Then I was prescribed Deanxit Flupenthixol and Melitracen 10 mg once every day till last month. Now I am trying to withdraw by reducing the dose over a month time, taking one tablet every two days for two weeks, then half the medicine every two days for two weeks. Before this, I tried to withdraw two times under the doctors supervision. But both times I failed to be able to withdraw as both times, more likely my withdrawal symptoms got severe in three weeks and it was difficult to manage, so put back again on medication. Now I am in a stress-free environment and I hope withdrawal symptoms should be less severe and I might be able to withdraw. If in case, it is going to happen like the previous times causing severe symptoms, what should I do in that case? Is it fine that my method of withdrawal reducing the dose as mentioned above is good enough?","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
If psychologically you are feeling stable for at least six months to a year, then you can try to cut down medication gradually. You can try tapering off the medication over a longer period of time to minimize the chances of withdrawal symptoms. For example, try taking half the dose for one day and full the next day alternately for two weeks. If you are not experiencing any withdrawal symptoms, then reduce the drug to half and take it daily for the next two weeks. If you are not experiencing any withdrawal symptoms, then take half-tablet on alternate days for further two weeks. You may stop the medication provided you are comfortable. This is a rough guide. At any stage, if you develop withdrawal symptoms, step up to the previous dose for a longer period and then try again. Sometimes it may take a few months to completely withdraw the medication. I have to say that Deanxit Flupenthixol and Melitracen is not the first line medication indicated for anxiety and depression. It is no longer used in many countries due to difficulties in withdrawal and side effects. I will recommend visiting a doctor locally as well to monitor and support you during the withdrawal period. Also, use psychological strategies to prevent any relapse in mood and anxiety symptoms.

"Hello doctor, I am suffering from sinusitis for the last six months. I have tried lots of medicines but there is no improvement. Because of the current scenario of COVID-19, I cannot visit any ENT specialist. Please help me and prescribe some medicines.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Yes, I understand how frustrating your problem can be. Sinusitis is usually secondary to a certain problem such as allergy which is the most common cause, once other rare causes are ruled out. So considering the treatment of this particular issue, we need to always treat the primary from its root source so that the effect remains for a longer time with the least amount of medications. What can be done? If you are having underlying allergic issues such as sneezing, watery nasal discharge, ear fullness, heaviness in the head, and facial regions, we need to treat the allergy first. You need to wear an n95 mask and nothing else other than that to prevent any irritative substance such as dust, fumes from entering your nose, and initiating the allergic cascade mechanism leading to its symptoms. Wearing a mask even at home, avoiding exposure to dust and other substances which instigate sneezing according to me is the single most important factor which you  have to take care of as other things mentioned below are all for symptomatic relief and we are not treating the allergy as such, precisely speaking. Take tablet Sinarest Acetaminophen, Chlorpheniramine, and Pseudoephedrine one tablet two times a day after food for 10 days, Allegra-M Fexofenadine and Montelukast one tablet two twice for 10 days, Duonase nasal spray two puffs in both nostrils twice daily for three continuous months do not inhale while applying the spray, tablet Mucomix 600 mg one tablet twice daily for 10 days. Do steam inhalation two or three times a day for supportive relief. Take Wysolone 10 mg once a day after breakfast for 10 days, tablet Pan D Pantoprazole one tablet before breakfast for 10days, Clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily for one month. Saltwater gargles 8 to 10 times a day will keep irritative substances away from the throat. All these medications will be useful only if you strictly follow the precautionary measures. The requirement of medications will automatically reduce once your symptoms come down with a decreased allergic load. Please do get a noncontrast CT computed tomography of the nose and paranasal sinuses and show it to me once you get it done in the subsequent follow-ups. I advise you for a follow up after two weeks of treatment, so I can evaluate and let you know about the further requirement of medications.

I understand your concern and would help you for sure. I have gone through the description you provided, and yes, you do have hemorrhoids. Your symptoms and finding are suggestive of the same. Hemorrhoids or piles are dilated and engorged veins in the rectal and anal region. When they rupture, they cause bleeding, most commonly when you have hard stools or are constipated. They can be in turn a consequence of chronic constipation too. The knot you felt is the same. You should avoid constipation and should try to have certain modifications in your diet. Consume more quantities of high fiber low residue diet like leafy vegetables, salads, fruits, etc. Also, drink plenty of water and fluids. This will prevent the occurrence of hemorrhoids in the future again. You can do Sitz baths or apply Lignocaine jelly for pain relief. Take laxatives in case of constipation.If the hemorrhoids progress, then you need to consult a surgeon for further evaluation and management.

"Hi doctor,I have been dealing with this issue for a couple of months. It all began after taking a senna leaf, which is a laxative. I should also want to mention that I had a thin stool for some time, but now it comes and goes. In the beginning, I also had a dark-colored stool, but that is no longer the case. My stool tends to be light-colored now. I plan to visit a GI soon but wonder if the symptoms I describe sound like anything. After a day of taking it, I had stomach cramps and was constipated. This went on for several months, but the stomach cramps disappeared however, constipation comes and goes. One symptom that has been constant the entire time is pressure, almost like in my pelvic area only when I am lying down. It is hard to distinguish if it is my pelvic area or rectum, to be honest. I recently took a laxative not too long ago, and it once again messed up my stomach but not as bad. I wondered if these symptoms sound like anything serious, as well as any correlation between taking a laxative and messing up my stomach. I went to urgent care a month ago and had a blood test and CT scan of my abdominal region, and it all came back normal.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
The senna is used in treatment for constipation. They are irritant laxatives, meaning they irritate the gut, cause cramps, and thus pass stools. So cramping, diarrhea, bloating are common side effects. However, they usually do not last for more than three days of their last use. Persistent symptoms of constipation and cramping suggest there is probably another problem going on within your bowels. To tell you the seriousness of the situation, I need to know more about the existent information you just shared. Plus, there are specific other questions to establish the primary cause of your constipation.
Do you have any weight loss?
Any family history of colon or rectum cancers or abdominal cancers?
I understand that you started to have this problem this year, but do you have constipation issues from a young age as back as you can recall?
Do you notice that the pain you describe changes in intensity after you pass gas or stools?
I understand you had hard stools in the past, and with abdominal cramping, do you still observe hard stools regularly? How many bowel movements you have in a week?
Do you require to sit for 30 minutes or so before you able to pass stools?
Do you ever use a finger to impact stools from the rectum manually? or used self enema?
Now in your age, there are some common causes of constipation. Given your history, the highly likely possibility is Irritable bowel syndrome  IBS. Which is a nonserious condition, does require targeted medicinal treatment, and symptoms often go away. However, this is simply a hypersensitive gut that tends to become constipated and causes pain, which remains and tends to have an on-off course during life.
Lack of fiber in the diet, lack of regular exercise, and decreased water intake are other essential components, common but overlooked. If you have any problem with that, the correction of that will solve your problem.
Lastly, there is a set of another disorder called pelvic outlet obstruction. Or dyssynergic defecation or obstructive defecation defecation passage of stools. In this, there is a paradoxical contraction of the anal canal muscles in response to the urge to pass stools. Usually, it should relax and allow stools to pass quickly.

"Hello doctor,
This query is about a 5-year-old girl with consistent belly pain above the belly button.
It started a little over a month ago and she has vomited a few times throughout that time period. Her eating has diminished and she complains of pain after she eats.
Her abdomen X-ray was done three times. The first time it showed constipation. The second time, it showed an increase in constipation, and then we started enemas, suppositories, and Lactulose. The third X-ray showed an improvement in constipation. Then acid reflux medicine was started, but she still complained of belly pain.
The child is missing almost every day of school or being picked up early, does not eat much, and lays around most of the day.
She has been going to the bathroom however, the poop appears like small hard balls.
Kindly advise on what to do?
Thank you.","Hello,

I am writing this on behalf of my wife, who is 56 years old. She has been suffering from severe low back pain since last 8 to 10 years and left shoulder joint pain since last one year. Please find the enclosed reports, for your kind perusal. We shall be grateful for your valuable opinion and advice about further treatment and management, at your earliest convenience.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have gone through your query and reports attachment removed to protect patient identity with diligence and would like you to know that I am here to help you.
She has got cervical spondylosis. This probably causes the shoulder pain rather than a problem in the shoulder. Avoiding forward bending will help relieve her pain. For that
Increase the height of TV in your home by two feet.
If she uses a computer, increase the monitor height by one foot.
She has to read books, or use mobile, tablets, etc. lying down on her stomach where the neck will bend backward and she will feel relief and not in sitting position where the neck will be bending forward.
There is a disc prolapse which causes back pain. Surgery is needed for this.
Take care.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"

My 8-year-old son has been having chest pains since six months.   He takes medication for acid reflux, anxiety, and asthma currently.  We had a CT scan done but the doctor says it should nothing to be concerned about, however, some of the stuff in the report I feel is of concern and I am looking for clarification on some things. He is currently on Omeprazole, Levalbuterol, Atomoxetine, Flovent, and Guanfacine.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have gone through the CT report attachment removed to protect patient identity. There are variations in the branching pattern, but this is fine to have. Many individuals have such a branching pattern without any consequences. Slight bulging was mentioned at ramification, but they also commented that it appears to be within normal limits. And such slight bulging would not cause pain or would not have any consequences unless there is any obstruction within it. Important is that there is no obstruction or abnormal course of left coronary artery. They have mentioned that the left coronary has a slightly high take off which is fine and unlikely to be responsible for symptoms or complications. So, as far as coronaries are concerned, they are unlikely to be responsible for his symptoms and unlikely to end up in any adverse consequences. Now I guess, he must have had an ECG and echo, which would give additional assurance to this. Now if according to symptoms, they are again not classical of heart. If they were cardiac then they would have certainly aggravated by activities. So unlikely to be a cardiac issue. Now considering his reflux issue, the first possibility should be considered of acid reflux and secondly of musculoskeletal even if there is no definitive demonstrable tenderness. Omeprazole may not be able to counteract reflux totally. So it is worthwhile to try locally acting agents like syrup Sucralfate and see if it helps. Light meals and some walking after meals. Locally acting agent Diclofenac gel may also be tried. I hope this helps.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 96, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 7, 'transparency': 8}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"

Having sperms of 95 mml is a normal value. The thickness of the ejaculate is not determined by the amount or quality of semen. It is determined by the amount of prostate fluid and lubricant fluid produced by other glands. The amount and texture of these liquids are variable and there is nothing to do with your ability to make your wife pregnant. You can take Zinc tablets.

"Hello doctor,
Four months ago, I faced severe pain in the lower abdomen area with a discharge from my penis twice. After that, inside the penis, there was itching and a burning sensation. I cannot hold urine for more than 2 hours while sitting. Sometimes I can see transparent pus on my penis in the morning. Sometimes I feel pain in the scrotum. I feel good in some situations, like walking and standing, as I do not feel any symptoms, and in some situations, like jumping and running, these symptoms feel worse. I am not married and have had no sexual encounters. I am a non-alcoholic and non-smoker. I have done a blood test, normal urine analysis, and normal urine culture, and no growth was found. I have done ultrasonography of the abdomen with PVR, and no abnormalities were seen. My urine flow test was normal, but there was a low flow when holding the urine for a long time. I need to find out what the disease is. Please help me, doctor. Currently, I am taking Azithral 500 mg, Exena 50 mg, and Alfoo 10 mg, but these medicines have not given any good results. Earlier I was using Doxylag 100 mg and Buscopan 10 mg, and these gave good results.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Having gone through your symptoms, it seems you are having a problem known as chronic prostatitis. This is an infection of the prostate gland, and it has a tendency to reoccurrence and increase and decrease in severity. Your earlier medication of Doxycycline will have a good effect because it works well in chronic prostatitis. Though this problem is not a danger to life, it does become very bothersome. My advice for you is to get a prostate examination done by a urologist to confirm the diagnosis. Intermittent prostatic massage by a urologist may help to relieve the problem. You will need to continue medication like Doxycycline or Nitrofurantoin for a long period of time under the guidance of a local urologist. This problem gets aggravated by anxiety, stress, and lack of sleep, so if you have these problems, you will need to take care of them also.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 95, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 5, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 96, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,I have started feeling weird sensations all over my body for seven months now, and they all happen at once and on a daily basis. My skin itches all over, especially my face and scalp. A lot of the times, when I speak, I sense a vibration in my eyes or a little bit lower. It is as an inner thread is vibrating. I have the urge to rub my eyes, and when I do, they squeak profusely. I also get the urge to scratch my skin. When I scratch some parts, I feel like I am scratching a thread, extending to other regions not only the scratched area. This is especially noticeable when I scratch my cheeks.My joints feel a little stiff and oily, and they crackle a lot when they feel like that. My fingers and palms also feel oily. My scalp and forehead feel tight and a little bit numb. My eyes are very sensitive to light, and there is an increase in eye floaters. Halos around lamp posts at night and double vision when I look at vehicle lights at night.I also feel an inner pressure in my nose when I am speaking. When I pronounce sounds like t, s, and z clearly, the pressure amplifies and sometimes my ears click. Thus, this pressure hinders my ability to speak normally. I used to be a presenter of radio shows, and my pronunciation and enunciation skills were top notch, and the fact that I can no longer speak as well because of this pressure concerns me a lot. I also feel like my olfactory sense has diminished a little bit. I have also noticed that I do not breathe as much through my nose.I am fatigued and depressed. I feel like I do not get enough sleep even when I sleep 8 to 9 hours. Sometimes, when I do not sleep enough, there is a dull pain in my ears and eyes.Some things that may or may not be related to what I have written above  are red itchy blotches appear on my skin after I take warm showers, sometimes I feel like my tongue and gums are slightly burning, there is a small internal lump in front of my ear that has not subsided for about seven months, and I have moderate acne. I have a history of moderate arterial hypertension 14080 mmHg. However, it went back to normal 12070 mmHg.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
These all symptoms point towards a chronic condition. You will have to undergo few more investigation as follows.
Basic hemogram.
Thyroid function tests.
Check for autoimmune diseases status, consult a physician and get tested for ANA antinuclear antibody.
Do you ever get a low-grade fever? Have you lost some weight recently?
This can also be a part of allergy to non-specific antigen. You can rule that out by going to an allergy specialist, who can test you for some common antigens.
Also, consider taking antihistamines like Fexofenadine or Levocetirizine, after consulting your local physician.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern. Hard or firm nodes are only one of the important factors. Sub centimetric nodes size less than a centimeter that do not show size changes over time usually do not bother us. Also, the fixity of the nodes to either the skin or the underlying tissues and mobility of the nodes is important. A mobile non-fixed node is not harmful. So, in your case, it is just benign lymphadenitis. You have to observe for the development of any new symptoms. Also, you can go for fine needle aspiration cytology in case of further doubts.

What do you recommend for healing, pain management, and preventing wound infection?","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
You mentioned about the bleeding of the gums after scaling. Usually, you can see bleeding gums and cut-like appearance near the border of the gingiva due to one of the following reasons.
Heavy calculus deposits masks the inflamed gingiva
Mild trauma may occur during scaling.
White appearance on the floor of the mouth suggests ulcers. It may be due to
Prolonged pressure from the mouth mirror during isolation.
Stress.
Gastritis.
Spicy food that irritates.
Prevention
Avoid spicy food.
Metronidazole gel.
Gargle your mouth with warm water with a pinch of salt thrice daily.
Gentle brushing.
Massaging your gums after brushing with finger from the gums towards the teeth.

It seems like you are an atopic patient. Eye Allergy can occur separately, or in some patients, there is a history of other allergies like recurrent flu or itching on the body. Allergy in atopic patients is caused by multiple allergens like wind, dust, sunlight, animal dander, pollens, or smoke. I suggest you must try to identify the causative allergen. You must wear sunglasses whenever you go out in the sun. You must not use carpets in your room because they can store dust and may trigger allergies.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Thank you for your query.
I have seen the X-rays and understand the pattern of the fracture attachment removed to protect the patients identity. Ideally, surgery should be done as apart from fracture, there is mild subluxation of the joint. Now the question is fitness for the procedure and when it should be done. Fitness has to be decided in conjunction with an anesthetist and physician so that they can examine it in detail and let the surgeon know what is the correct approach. Also, blood sugars will have to be managed with insulin during hospitalization followed by appropriate medications as determined by the diabetologist at the time of discharge. As of now strict limb elevation, intensive ice packs, and appropriate medications need to be given to decrease swelling, and pain and make skin conditions suitable for a surgical procedure. Kindly send me clinical pictures of the involved ankle so that I can understand what skin looks like.

I am a 43-year-old male. I have been taking Xarelto for about a year-and-a-half due to a pulmonary embolism that I had. They were very small.

Is basically the only thing that can be done is just continuing to take Xarelto?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Xarelto is the brand name for the generic drug Rivaroxaban. It blocks the activity of certain clotting factors in the blood.
It is used to prevent or treat deep vein thrombosis in which blood clots form in the deep veins of the legs. This can lead to pulmonary embolism in certain cases as in yours and can be fatal.
Your current medication comprising of Xarelto daily is a form of prophylaxis to prevent the occurrence of deep vein thrombosis. The dose is lower than that when you are being treated for deep vein thrombosis.
There are other anticoagulants which can be used but Xarelto is preferred.
If you were to get another episode of deep vein thrombosis, the treatment would differ.  Deep vein thrombosis is associated with prolonged periods of inactivity, inherited clotting disorders, surgery, and certain cancers. Since in your case it is due to driving for prolonged periods, you could reduce that and try and walk around every 15 to 20 minutes.
If you smoke, then you should stop that as well.

I tried not to smoke for a day. But the next day, I would return back to the same. Recently, I came to know about a chewing gum called nicotex. It comes in 2 mg and 4 mg form. But I am not sure about this product.
So my question is, does cipla nicotex chewing gum help in quitting smoking? Also to buy this chewing gum, do I need a doctors prescription?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
As you have been a chronic smoker since last 10 years smoking 10-15 cigarettes per day, the body is presently addicted to nicotine and hence if you intend to leave it for a day, the nicotine withdrawal sets in. This may include
Headache.
Nausea.
Constipation or diarrhea.
Fatigue, drowsiness, and insomnia.
Irritability.
Difficulty in concentrating.
Anxiety.
Depressed mood.
These Nicotex chewing gums have nicotine in them in varying concentrations which allow a sustained but minimal release of nicotine while chewing. This nicotine is absorbed through buccal mucosa thus not allowing the withdrawal symptoms to become evident, but the benefit is that you are free from most of the side effects of smoking per se, especially the smoke entering into lungs which may lead to lung diseases in future. This is a substitute to nicotine supplementation and is being prescribed for chronic smokers who wish to discontinue it slowly by following the principle of slow desensitization.
These are available off the counter and no prescription is required for the same. You may try it and try to reduce your smoking urges. In the end, Nicotex can just help you in a way but you need to develop a will to quit smoking and that is very important. You may try and see how you respond to it as every person responds differently to its use. It has been seen to give successful outcomes, but again will power is still the most important thing behind quitting smoking.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 86, 'clinical_accuracy': 19, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}"
"Hello, I am a 36-year-old male who recently recovered from pneumonia, which was successfully treated with antibiotics three months ago. However, I have been experiencing discomfort in my lungs during flu or cough episodes, along with severe pain in colder temperatures. Are these ongoing symptoms might be linked to the pneumonia I had previously. Can I tolerate cold temperatures? please advice.","Hello,Welcome to icliniq.com.I read your query and understood your concern.It is possible that the ongoing symptoms you are experiencing could be related to the pneumonia you had three months ago, but it is also possible that they could be unrelated. Pneumonia can sometimes cause lingering symptoms, such as coughing or shortness of breath, but these symptoms should improve over time.The discomfort in your lungs during flu or cough episodes could be a sign of bronchitis, which is an infection of the bronchial tubes that can cause coughing, chest discomfort, and shortness of breath. If you are experiencing severe pain in colder temperatures, this could be a sign of cold-induced asthma, which is a type of asthma that is triggered by cold, dry air. If you are still experiencing symptoms three months after your pneumonia diagnosis, it is a good idea to follow up with your doctor. In the meantime, you may want to take steps to manage your symptoms, such as staying hydrated, using a humidifier, and avoiding triggers that could worsen your symptoms, such as cigarette smoke or air pollution. As for whether you can tolerate cold temperatures, this will depend on the underlying cause of your symptoms. If you are experiencing cold-induced asthma, you may want to take steps to avoid exposure to cold, dry air, such as wearing a scarf over your nose and mouth in cold weather, or using a mask with a HEPA filter to filter out cold, dry air. If you are experiencing other symptoms, such as coughing or shortness of breath, you may want to take steps to manage these symptoms, such as using a bronchodilator or an inhaler to help open up your airways. In summary, if you are still experiencing symptoms three months after your pneumonia diagnosis, it is a good idea to follow up with your healthcare provider. They can help to determine the cause of your symptoms and provide appropriate treatment. In the meantime, you may want to take steps to manage your symptoms, such as staying hydrated, using a humidifier, and avoiding triggers that could worsen your symptoms, such as cigarette smoke or air pollution.

"Hi doctor,
A year ago, my four teeth were extracted for braces two uppers and two lower teeth. In the lower jaw, the teeth started moving to fill the gaps, but in the upper jaw, the teeth have not moved still and are looking ugly. Is this normal? If yes, how long will it take to move? Thank you.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Orthodontic treatment is broadly divided into four phases, leveling and aligning, space closure, finishing and detailing and retention. As you mentioned about four teeth getting extracted, it is a normal procedure followed worldwide for certain cases. Leveling and aligning depend on how much crowding is present in both arches and how much movement will be required in both of them to get a well-aligned arch. If they are not aligned and space closure is initiated, it tends to result in an unesthetic appearance, and management in later stages becomes difficult. In your case, uppers might have had more crowding than lowers and more discrepancy in levels, hence longer alignment time. The lower arch tends to move faster and shows space closure much earlier than the upper arch due to certain factors like bone composition, food eating habits, etc. In lower, leveling and aligning would have been finished, and hence space closure would have been started by the doctor, while in upper, it would still require some more alignment before beginning the space closure, hence the delay. If you see the upper front teeth well aligned at the same level and following a gentle curve as they go back, stay rest assured. Alignment is almost over, and soon, space closure will be initiated. Generally, it takes about 18 to 20 months for cases with four teeth extraction to complete. Hence, based on the details provided, you are going on the right track soon, space closure should be initiated. Do reach out for further information and clarifications.

"Hello doctor,
My sisters AMH is 0.7 ngmL. She is 40 years old and trying for her second child. She conceived her first child naturally ten years back, but now she has one failed IVF and six failed IUIs, and spontaneous egg rupture before egg retrieval. But she is still trying for a second child. Will she be successful if she tries for her second IVF with an AMH of 0.7 ngmL? Does she has any chance of natural conception?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I read your query and can understand your concern.
Please send me a detailed gynecological, medical, and drug history.
The normal level of AMH antiMullerian hormone is 1.5 to 4 ngmL. The lower level can be 1 ngmL to have a conception.
If we talk about how naturally she can improve her fertility or egg reserves at the age of 40, that can help her very little, but better to have those tips as well.
1. Fish, high protein diet, food with DHEA dehydroepiandrosterone, more fibers, nuts, seeds, and fresh HDL high-density lipid oils to be taken on a long-term basis.
2. Daily exercise, walking, and yoga for having normal BMI basal metabolic rate and weight.
3. Recreational activities to have better emotional health and have to quit recreational drugs if she or her partner used to take them as these not only reduce fertility but also can cause congenital anomalies.
4. Have folic acid daily.
Due to age, it is better to have IVF in vitro fertilization with hormonal support at every step. It could be ICSI intracytoplasmic sperm injection or other methods to have pregnancy as soon as possible. As I advised above, it is better to start work immediately, have urgent consultation with a fertility clinic, and start a healthy workup.
Hope this helps.

That is really sad to hear about your mother but I would like to add into your information that evidence suggests that hormone replacement therapy HRT does not significantly increase the risk of breast cancer. It is only contraindicated if the person taking HRT has breast cancer already.

Many over-the-counter drugs like evening Primrose oil, etc., are available which are helpful to many women in relieving their symptoms. Another way is the choice of route of administration of hormones like pills, skin patches, vaginal rings, etc. These again depend on your symptoms and your overall medical fitness.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
After reviewing your medical history, I would like to explain that you need to closely monitor your blood pressure values for a couple of days several times daily in order to conclude on your average BP blood pressure trends. It seems that an abnormally elevated high BP value may have caused your complaints. Anyway, it is necessary to discuss with your doctor on the possibility of performing a medical checkup, including a careful physical exam and some laboratory tests like complete blood count, thyroid, renal and liver function tests, fasting blood glucose level, blood electrolytes level, an ECG electrocardiogram at rest. In case several BP values result abnormally high you may need to start an anti-hypertensive therapy.

"Hi doctor,
I want to ask whether too much earwax in the babys ear is normal. My daughter has a lot of earwax coming out from her right ear, and it has a terrible odor. Currently, I am not giving any medications, just vitamins. She is 4 months and 3 weeks old, height 64.5 cm, and weight 6 kilograms.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
If there is foul-smelling fluid coming out of the ear, it cannot be wax but indicates an infection. The possible reason for this is due to improper posturing of the child while breastfeeding. The childs body should be in an oblique fashion while feeding to prevent the recurrent entry of the milk into the eustachian tubes. This happens as the eustachian tubes in children are more horizontal than adults, and infants can suckle and breathe simultaneously. You can also consider the following treatment advice. 1. Syrup Augmentin Amoxicillin and Clavulanate 228.5 mg or 3 ml, three times a day after feeds for one week. 2. Syrup Sinarest Acetaminophen, Chlorpheniramine, and Pseudoephedrine 3 ml two times a day for one week. 3. Otrivin p Xylometazoline two drops two times a day for one week. Please follow these instructions for one week and let me know about the progress. Please ensure that you do not use earbuds or Q-tips cotton swab to clean the ear. Please keep the ear dry.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Swelling near Adams apple is most likely a thyroid swelling. Normal TSH thyroid stimulating hormone level is 0.5-5 mIUL. Your high TSH level confirms that it is a thyroid swelling.
Elevated anti-TPO antibody anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody suggests autoimmune thyroiditis. It means your bodys protective mechanism is attacking your own thyroid gland. But, there is nothing to be worried.

Can you explain how Tukysa differs from other medications for advanced breast cancer, and what factors contribute to its suitability for individuals in her situation? Please help.
Thank you.","Hi,Welcome to icliniq.com.I read your query and understand your concern.Tukysa Tucatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of HER2 a protein that causes cancer to grow fast. In vitro, Tucatinib inhibits phosphorylation of HER2 and HER3, resulting in inhibition of downstream MAPK mitogen-activated protein kinase and AKT Protein kinase B, signaling and cell proliferation, and shows anti-tumor activity in HER2 expressing tumor cells. Tuksya is a smaller molecule than trastuzumab, so it can target the part of HER2 on the inside of cancer cells. In this way, TUKYSA and trastuzumab work together to completely block the HER2 activity that promotes the growth of cancer.In a concise form, It disrupts the internal signaling pathway of the tumor cells and prevents tumor cell proliferation. Every medication has its own mechanism of action, and depending on the tumor type and synergistic mechanism of medicines, these are advised as part of treatment. Most of these medications are standard treatment for neoplasms and a standard regimen is followed almost all over the world.

"Hello doctor,I have been enduring these excruciating migraines for what feels like an eternity, and I am desperately seeking relief.

How does it function, and what outcomes have been observed in patients undergoing this treatment?Thank you.","Hello,Welcome to icliniq.com.I understand your concern. Eptinezumab is a relatively new migraine treatment administered through a series of infusions. It belongs to the calcitonin gene-related peptide CGRP inhibitor class, which blocks the activity of CGRP, a protein associated with the inflammatory response in migraines. Studies indicate that Eptinezumab significantly reduces migraine frequency and severity in patients unresponsive to other treatments. In clinical trials, those receiving Eptinezumab had an average of 7.4 fewer migraine days per month than those on a placebo.The treatment consists of four infusions, each lasting 30 minutes. The initial infusion is followed by three more at four-week intervals, typically administered by a healthcare provider in a medical setting. Potential side effects include mild infusion reactions like hives, itching, rash, dizziness, and fatigue, which usually resolve on their own.It is crucial to discuss Eptinezumabs potential benefits and risks with your doctor to determine its appropriateness for your condition. They can guide you on managing side effects and monitor your response over time. If previous migraine treatments were ineffective, exploring Eptinezumab as an option is advisable. However, individual experiences with this therapy vary, and results may differ from person to person.I hope I have addressed all your queries. Take care.

"Hello doctor,
My 61-day-old baby was diagnosed with anorectal malformation during birth and a colostomy was done. He is 11.02 Ibs now and I want to know when the second surgery can be done.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I read your query and can understand your concern.
Usually, a second surgery for a high anorectal malformation is performed once the baby is well stabilized and growing well, approximately three to four months after the first surgery. It also depends on the site of the problem as well as on the treating surgeon. Some surgeons do it once the baby attains approximately 22.05 Ibs of weight if they do it in 2 stage plan. Some surgeons might do it in 3 stage plan.
As your baby is otherwise growing well, I expect they may be planning to do it soon but the final timing depends on the pediatric surgeon. I suggest just sticking to the advice of your surgeon. You are taking care of your baby so well, that is why he is growing well. The credit goes to you also along with your surgeon. I trust everything will be fine soon and your baby will be passing motion normally.

"Hi doctor,
Are there any specific medicines or therapies to treat depression-related anosmia?
Thank you.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern.
Depression does not relate to anosmia loss of smell. Anosmia is an organic condition and you need to take the help of an ENT specialist. However, if you are talking about insomnia sleep disturbances, then it is surely related to depression. Depression and insomnia are interconnected. If you do not sleep well, it can cause depression. If you have depression then it can affect your sleep. I suggest you take tablet Escitalopram 10 mg Escitalopram oxalate 10 mg daily in the morning for depression and tablet Clonazepam 0.5 mg Benzodiazepine 0.5 mg at night. Consult your doctor and take medicines accordingly. You can also take the help of the nearest psychologist for counseling, as it will help you relieve your problem or stress.
I hope this information will help you. Please revert in case of more queries.

"Hello doctor,
I am trying to get pregnant but I am breastfeeding. I only had two periods after giving birth, but I do not have a period in over two months. What can help me conceive without giving up breastfeeding?","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
May I ask how long it has been since your last delivery? From your given history of breastfeed, I can understand that your baby is still quite small and so I would suggest until he or she is at least three to four years of age before trying to conceive again. This is so that in between deliveries your body needs time to recover and repair itself. If you get pregnant too soon it will adversely affect your baby.
As your cycles have not yet regularized it implies that you may not be ovulating regularly. This can happen sometimes during breastfeeding. It will resume order on its own. I would suggest you start the following iron and calcium tablets as  well as folic acid.
1. Tablet Livogen XT once daily at night with lemon water.
2. Tablet Calcimax 500 mg once daily.
3. Tablet Folvite 5 mg once daily if you are planning to conceive.
Please continue to breastfeed your baby regardless of whether your periods come or not. And kindly consider what I have explained above.","{'score': 87, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 93, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

I am 39 years old, severely obese. I have been experiencing dizzy spells and pulsations in the back of my head. The pulsations are severe when I am sleeping. There are shocks in the head occasionally but more while sleeping.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com. We need to do an magnetic resonance imaging MRI brain with MRS spectroscopy, MRA angiography, MRV venography, MRI cervical spine with MRA neck vessels with whole spine screening for evaluation of dizzy spells, pulsations in the back of the head. Obesity or overweight can be due to four main causes 1. Primary genetic insulin resistance. 2. Not doing physical work and being the so-called couch potato sedentary lifestyle. 3. Diseases related to fat metabolism dyslipidaemias. 4. Eating too much also called gluttony. Of these, if your obesity and overweight are due to a sedentary lifestyle, you can reduce your weight and waist circumference by walking, jogging, running, swimming, cardio, lifting weights, etc. If your obesity and overweight are due to eating too much, you can reduce your weight and excess fat by eating less. If your obesity and overweight are due to dyslipidemias, you can reduce your weight and excess fat by appropriate treatment. But, if your obesity and overweight are due to primary genetic insulin resistance, the only way you can reduce weight is by taking a low carbohydrate diet. Running miles on treadmill or starvation will not solve your problem. Before you start low carbohydrate high fat diet, we need to know what all you can take and what all you have to avoid. For this, a series of blood tests are needed. These are available as a package called metabolic profile A. If you have already done this, please send us the reports. If you have not done this, please do it. The technician will come, collect blood and you will get the report the next day by mail.","{'score': 85, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 5, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"

I read your query and understand your concern. I would like to know if you have been diagnosed with allergic rhinitis, asthma, or any other allergic conditions. Fluticasone nasal spray is an intranasal steroid usually prescribed for allergic respiratory conditions. It works by reducing the immune response to inhaled allergens. It should not be used to treat common cold or other infectious conditions as it can make them worse. The dose of Fluticasone is two sprays in each nostril usually, provided that each spray is 50 micrograms in strength. The strength of each spray should be written on the drug pack.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
It is sad that your child is going through this skin issue.
I saw the picture attachment removed to protect the patients identity, and it looks like eczema, specifically atopic eczema. Eczema flares up during winter when the skin becomes dry. The key is to keep the skin moisturized with a good moisturizer containing ceramide. Ceramide is essential for skin barrier function. It helps to heal the rashes faster. For example, Cerave moisturizer for kids or Eucerin Glycerin and mineral oil.
1. Use moisturizing soap.
2. Apply moisturizer soon after showering.
3. He would require low-potent topical corticosteroid cream at night for one week only. Apply Hydrocortisone 1 topical cream to rashes at night. Use the moisturizer in the morning.
4. Avoid using hot showers, and use lukewarm water to take a bath.
5. Use a cool mist humidifier in his room.
6. Keep him away from pet animals if you have any.
7. Always wear cotton clothes. The inner layer of the cloth should be cotton.
Does he have a similar rash on his other skin folds?

"Hi doctor,
I am a 29-year-old male with a weight of 121 pounds and a height of five feet. I suffer from IBS. After going to the toilet, I have pain while defecating and after that, I have a burning sensation in the anus region for a day. Sometimes I have abdominal pain and I think of it as IBS. Before and after going toilet, my anal lining remains normal but during defecation, it bulges out and I am not sure whether these are hemorrhoids or mucosal rectal prolapse. After defecation, I have a burning sensation in my anus and mild pain in my left side. I also suffer from constipation and I always strain while having a bowel movement. When I am anxious, I suffer from diarrhea and my stool remains liquid. If I am not anxious, I suffer from constipation.

I want to know whether I have hemorrhoids or mucosal rectal prolapse. How to cure them?","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Pain while defecation and a feeling of bulge occur mostly due to hemorrhoids and sometimes, it occurs in association with a spot of blood on the toilet seat. It is difficult to differentiate hemorrhoid and rectal prolapse. It needs an examination to be done by a surgeon and it is difficult to predict them with history alone. As you are young and healthy, it is unlikely to have a prolapse. Your abdominal pain occurs due to IBS and so you have intermittent diarrhea and constipation along with it. To get relief, you need to fix your bowel habits with more fibers. You can take a stool softener like Normacol one to two sachet a day till having soft stools. You need to treat IBS irritable bowel syndrome using psychological therapy and it helps to provide relief for diarrhea caused due to stress.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 95, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 5, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hi doctor,
I am a 23-year-old male. My height is 6 feet, and I weigh 165 pounds. I have had dark circles for two years. Please help.
Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
It is important to rule out the causes of dark circles. It may be due to hereditary stress, lack of sleep, or nutritional deficiencies. Make sure to sleep seven to eight hours per day. You should consume a nutritious diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables and drink plenty of water. You may apply Kojiglo cream on the dark circles at night after washing your face. Make sure you use sunscreen in the daytime.
Adequate sleep is crucial for allowing the body to repair and rejuvenate, including the skin. A balanced and nutritious diet, rich in fruits and vegetables, can provide essential vitamins and antioxidants that support healthy skin. Staying hydrated by drinking plenty of water is also beneficial for maintaining skin health.
As for the topical treatment, Kojiglo cream may help with reducing pigmentation and brightening the under-eye area.
Additionally, using sunscreen during the day is important to protect the delicate skin around the eyes from harmful UV ultraviolet rays and prevent further damage.
Remember that results may vary for each individual, and it is important to be patient and consistent with any skincare routine.
I hope these suggestions are helpful, and if you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out.

I have tuberculosis TB disease, type1 respiratory failure. Oxygen was given, oxygenation improves but falls to LVL on presentation. What support should be given before the onset of hypercapnia? I have dry cough for two weeks, blood in sputum, fever, sweating and weight loss.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com. As you said, the patient has tuberculosis TB, hypoxia is more common which leads to type 1 respiratory failure. So only supplemental oxygen is not enough. We should start noninvasive ventilation as early as possible before hypercarbia sets in. So the possible options for non-invasive ventilation NIV are continuous positive airway pressure CPAP or bilevel positive airway pressure BIPAP depending on availability. The inspiratory positive airway pressure IPAP and expiratory positive airway pressure EPAP pressures can be set up according to blood oxygen levels and oxygen saturation to be aimed to keep above 95 . Minimal sedation will keep the patient calm and also help to reduce further hemoptysis. Supportive measures like good nutrition and good nursing care should help to recover faster. Frequently keep a watch on blood gases. If NIV is not helping to keep oxygen above 95  or hypercarbia sets in, mechanical ventilation may be needed. Ultimately we have to titrate depending on the blood oxygen levels. Antitubercular treatment must be continued simultaneously. Antibiotics according to infection markers. The probable cause is TB. Investigation to be done is arterial blood gas. The differential diagnosis is pneumonia. The treatment plan include NIV and anti TB treatment.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 95, 'clinical_accuracy': 19, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 9, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"

I pass my stool quite comfortably every morning. But, after this, when I pass stools during the day, I have to use some force. I do not have any lower or upper abdominal pain or cramps. I do not see any blood in my stool with the naked eye. I do not have any lump or pain around my anal area. I do pass my stools once in the morning every day. But, after lunch or in the evening, I have to put some pressure. I do not have any painful symptoms. Please tell me if it is normal.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
The symptoms you have raised do not seem abnormal.
Stool frequency can normally vary from three times a day to thrice a week. A good defecation in the morning is definitely a healthy sign. Any passage of stool during the rest of the day depends only on the stimulus as well as the remnant volume of stools, which cannot be always similar to that of the morning. If any new symptoms pop up, you may require an evaluation.
My advice in this regard would be
Never strain at stools.
Be well hydrated the whole day. Consume two to three liters of water daily.
Consume a diet rich in fibers such as oats, apples, dal lentils, beans, and other vegetables.
Have regular physical activities.
Remain stress-free.
Be healthy and enjoy life.

First of all, this is not acceptable if you take I-pill frequently. As these pills  are of high hormonal content, it can mess up your internal hormonal balance.

1 Bowel blockage is a emergency, and it must be corrected. Sometimes without surgery, but most of the time, it needs surgery. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast must have been done considering your history to find out the cause.
2 Diverticulitis or diverticular disease can cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, bleeding, and sometimes bowel perforation leak but is less likely to cause mechanical bowel obstruction.
3 Colonoscopy would be considered, but if you have recent bowel surgery, immediate post-operative colonoscopy should be avoided for a couple of weeks, considering stitches inside.
4 I have seen pictures of your stools. This seems to be particularly digested food particles rather than worms.
5 Check your diet. If there is a high-fiber diet or raw vegetables, try to avoid that.
6 For confirmation, submit the stool sample for microscopic analysis stool routine examination next time. This would tell exactly whether these are worms or undigested food particles.
7 Stools with blood can be positive immediately after surgery or with medications you would be on, but yes, you need a colonoscopy.

I can understand your concern.
Antral gastric erosion is a condition where there is a loss of the surface layer of the stomach lining in the antrum the lower part of the stomach, which can cause symptoms like belching, burping, and burning sensation in the chest. In addition to medication, there are some lifestyle changes you can make that may help reduce your symptoms. These include
Avoid triggering foods like spicy and dairy foods.
Eat smaller and more frequent meals. Eating smaller meals throughout the day can help ease the workload on your stomach and reduce symptoms.
Avoid lying down after eating as this can help prevent acid from backing up into your esophagus and causing heartburn.
Manage the stress levels. Stress can worsen digestive symptoms, so find ways to manage stress, such as through exercise or relaxation techniques.
Quit smoking as it can irritate the lining of the stomach and increase the risk of developing ulcers.
I hope this helps.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
From this history, it seems that you have developed paronychia. It occurs due to infection of skin around the nails either due to bacteria or candida. It can occur due to trauma or injury to the nails or irritation. As mentioned in the history, washing hands repeatedly can cause irritation and paronychia. You can take a tablet of Doxycycline 100 mg one tablet daily at night for seven days. You can use Gentamicin eye drops and put two drops three times daily on the lesion for two weeks. You can use Clotrimazole cream and apply it daily at night for ten days. When you wash your hands every time you try to apply a good moisturizer on the hands. Have a follow up after two weeks.","{'score': 60, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 7}","{'score': 80, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 5, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"

Welcome to icliniq.com.
Thank you for your query
I understand your concern. Your symptoms are suggestive of an upper respiratory tract infection. It can be in form of allergic rhinitis or sinusitis. I suggest you investigate with CBC complete blood count report to guide you further. You can be prescribed decongestants like Phenylephrine or Levocetirizine for symptomatic relief.
Avoid excess spicy food intake.
Steam inhalation three times a day with warm water.
Salt-added lukewarm water gargle also can be beneficial.
Drink lots of water.
You can take Paracetamol for getting relief from the fever.

The time at which the tongue crib appliance is placed is usually in earlier visits at the start of treatment. However, this decision depends on a multitude of factors, along with your orthodontist treatment approach. It varies with each orthodontist. Also, elastics and e-chain are used for many different purposes like correction of bite, closing spaces, aiding in alignment, retraction, etc. So again, it depends on what tooth movement your teeth require. The simplest way of knowing is to ask your orthodontist for these details.","{'score': 86, 'clinical_accuracy': 19, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 8}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 5, 'transparency': 8}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hi,
I have acne and scars. I have had itching and burning slightly over my face for six months. I have faced this issue before, However, they got reduced and have re appearted again.
Kindly advise.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
After reading through the information provided from your end, as well as after viewing the image, it appears to be grade 2 acne vulgaris. As you have mentioned in the previous history of acne, they may usually appear on and off depending upon multiple external and internal factors, as mentioned below.
Genetic susceptibility, where then there is a family history of a similar condition that can be transmitted, due to hormonal fluctuations within the body, especially among the androgen levels, which results in the excess secretion of sebum, thereby stimulating the formation of acne by triggering bacteria within the skin, due to stress, due to use of skin care products or makeup products, due to any underlying medical condition and any medications used for the same, due to dietary changes as well as climate changes. It is pretty common to see a condition called PCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome among young females, which may also be associated with menstrual irregularities, unwanted facial hair growth, hair loss, weight gain, etc., which may or may not be present. Polycystic ovarian syndrome must be ruled out to treat acne completely. Therefore I request you consult a gynecologist in person to rule out PCOS.
My advice
Aloe extract, Salicylic acid, and Glycolic acid foaming face wash are to be used in the morning and at night. Apply a sufficient quantity, massage in gentle circular motions for one minute and wash off. You may need to continue it for months.
Clindamycin and Benzoyl peroxide gel is to be applied in the morning after using the face wash on the acne spots. They may be continued for months together till the rash is healed.
Clindamycin and Tretinoin cream may be used on alternate nights only after using the face wash at night and cleaning and drying the area well. It needs to be ensured that there is no moisture during the application of this medication. The smallest quantity of the medication possible, almost a size of a grain of rice quantity, may be used and applied in a very thin layer on the affected acne spots only. First-time users experience a burning sensation, redness, and slight peeling. However, if used with caution and in the right quantity, as mentioned above, and in a very thin layer, they are very beneficial and would not cause any adverse effects.
Capsule Doxycycline and Lactobacillus 100 mg twice daily are to be taken with water in the morning and at night after food for ten days. This is an antibiotic therefore, it needs to be made sure that there is no history of any allergy to antibiotics before consuming this medication.
Tablet Pantoprazole 40 mg twice daily in the morning and at night 30 minutes before consuming food to prevent acidity due to antibiotics for ten days.
Vitamin C tablet 500 mg chewable tablet to be taken daily in the morning after food. They may be consumed for two months. This helps in reducing the recurrence of acne as well as has antioxidant properties. It needs to be made sure that extremely hot food items or drinks or milk have to be avoided consumption of this medication.
Make sure to avoid milk and dairy products, red meat, sweets, and fried and oily food, as they may trigger acne. Make sure to consume more fruits, vegetables, fiber, and at least ten glasses of water daily in a 250 ml glass size.
Facial procedures in the form of glycolic acid chemical peels may be done at a dermatologists clinic. In this procedure solution consisting of glycolic acid is applied onto the face and kept for 5 to 10 minutes before washing off. This is usually done every week for six sessions at least. They help reduce the current acne and the formation of further acne by helping with regularizing the sebum secretion.
Acne scars reduce with the help of procedures more than medication intake. Therefore undergoing the procedures not only helps with active acne but also helps in clearing the acne scars to a great extent as well.
Undergoing procedures along with using medications will help in reducing acne to a great extent. However, acne may appear depending on the various external and internal factors mentioned above. Therefore using medications along with lifestyle modifications and procedures will be helpful.
Hope the information provided above was helpful and provided clarity.

Venography is an investigation to study the vein patterns by giving intravenous contrast. As such, this procedure is a minor one, but always we need to be prepared for any emergency.

"Hello doctor,I am a 19-year-old girl. I have recently found out that I am five weeks pregnant. However, I am not ready for a baby yet, and I would like to medically terminate my pregnancy. May I know what are the risks of getting an abortion done at this stage of pregnancy? Is this going to affect my fertility in the future? How early can I resume work and studies after the abortion? Please help.Thank you.","Hello,Welcome to icliniq.com.I can understand your concern. The risks of getting an abortion depend on the type and timing of the procedure. Generally, abortion is a safe and common health intervention, but it may have some side effects or complications, such asBleeding, cramping, or pain.Infection or fever.Incomplete abortion or retained tissue.Damage to the cervix, uterus, or other organs.Allergic reactions to medications.Emotional reactions or mental health issues.These risks are rare and can be prevented or treated by a qualified healthcare provider. The earlier you have an abortion, the lower the chances of complications.Having an abortion does not usually affect your fertility or future pregnancies. You can ovulate and become pregnant again within two weeks after an abortion, so it is important to use contraception or abstain from sex if you do not want to get pregnant. There is a very small risk of developing scarring in the uterus after a surgical abortion, which may cause infertility or pregnancy complications. This condition is called Asherman syndrome, and it is very rare. The recovery time after an abortion varies from person to person and depends on the type and stage of the abortion. Most people will feel well and resume their normal activities within a few days. However, some people may need more time to heal physically and emotionally.Some tips for self-care after an abortion areRest and relax as much as you need.Take painkillers as prescribed by your doctor.Use pads instead of tampons for bleeding.Avoid sex, douching, or inserting anything into your vagina for at least a week or until your doctor says it is safe.Follow up with your doctor for a check-up and contraception advice.Seek support from your friends, family, or a counselor if you feel sad, guilty, angry, or confused.Thanks for using icliniq, and have a nice day.","{'score': 96, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 93, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 5, 'transparency': 8}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

"Hello doctor,
I was diagnosed with seborrheic dermatitis and took Ketoconazole 2  shampoo. But, after one month of great evolution, my pruritus is back associated with hair fall. I am a medical student living under some emotional stress. Kindly help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
As per the history provided, seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp may appear on and off due to multiple factors throughout life for 99 percent of individuals, including hormonal fluctuations, climate changes, stress, history of generalized dry skin, infections, dietary changes, inadequate water intake, sharing of belongings like helmet or caps leading to mild fungal infections of the scalp. I would suggest using Ketoconazole plus zinc pyrithione shampoo twice a week, diluted with water in a 13 ratio, apply massage for one minute, Keep for five minutes and wash off. They must be used for at least eight weeks and may be repeated each time there are dandruff issues. Since they may be on and off, there is no cure to completely get rid of them since they form due to changes in skin texture. Take Capsule Itraconazole 200 mg once daily after dinner for two weeks. They may help get rid of the itching associated with it. Take Capsule Becosule vitamin C, zinc, vitamin B complex may be used in the above combinations after breakfast for one month. Stagnation of sweat on the scalp is one of the reasons for their appearance therefore, ensure to wipe off sweats persistence each time you sweat. Proper hydration helps in reducing their appearance. Ensure consuming at least 15 glasses 250 ml  of water a day. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with them and take medications with their consent. Seborrheic dermatitis may be on and off. As I have mentioned, stress management is one of the key factors which help with the regeneration and rejuvenation of scalp skin. Therefore, reduce stress levels by indulging more in leisure activities that lift your mood. Studying medicine may be stressful, but compromising health over it would not be right. Therefore, give your health priority, relax, and take one step at a time.

In your brothers report attachment removed to protect patient identity, I can see some kidney dysfunction as well as urinary tract infection.
So, I would recommend you to get his urine culture and blood sugar checked.
Accordingly, he would be treated with antibiotics that might eliminate the infection as well as improve his kidney functions.

Pain could be due to that also, but currently, the priority treatment is to be given to the urine infection as well as deranged kidney functions.

As you have taken pills, there is no chance of pregnancy. These symptoms could be because of hormonal changes due to the pill you have taken.

Dreams about pregnancy ,conception  are more common in women that have been trying to conceive for long time  and remained unsuccessful  or had a bad obstetric history such as multiple miscarriages, intrauterine fetal deaths, stillbirths, newborn babys death or unable to have proper sex life or unable to conceive due to hard job, responsibilities, financial or health issues, etc. In all the above cases anxiety is the major factor. Dreaming about happy married life, having conception or baby or taking care of a beautiful child is a greatest dream in most of the women that is so common and should be I think.
Being pregnant in dreams is to hoping for a healthy happy married life in normal ladies or in women with previous bad obstetrics history it is really a major concern as they try and struggle for a normal healthy baby. Similarly who want to be pregnant or those who does not want to be pregnant both can dream of conception but for both categories feeling would be different. In women who want to conceive it is dreaming as per their wish and for those who are not prepared for pregnancy or does not  want it, this dreaming conception could be a threat as to take proper precautions such as contraceptives or if they got symptoms of pregnancy unexpectedly then as anxiety.","{'score': 94, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 8}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 80, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"

"Hello doctor,
I have been dealing with insomnia for quite some time now, and my mind is constantly racing with thoughts. I am experiencing nightfall at various times, sometimes even during the day. It is happening infrequently, sometimes continuously, and sometimes with gaps of a week or more in between. Please help.
Thank you.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I read your query and can understand what you are going through.
Nightfall is a normal bodily function. When you reach puberty, your body starts producing semen continuously. Eventually, it needs to be released. If you are not sexually active or masturbating, it may discharge at night. This typically resolves once you become sexually active or start masturbating. It sounds like you may be experiencing major depressive disorder. There are non-pharmacological ways to manage depression that you can try. Here are some guidelines that may help
Try to exercise daily for 30-45 minutes, such as going for a walk. Exercise can improve your sleep quality.
Practice meditation for 20 minutes each day. Find a comfortable position and focus on your breathing. Let your thoughts come and go without trying to control them. This can help relax your mind and improve sleep.
Eat healthy, home-cooked meals, and avoid junk food. Stay hydrated by drinking enough water.
Spend quality time with friends and family, even if it is through video calls.
Engage in creative hobbies like reading, writing, painting, or learning new skills.
Ensure you get seven to eight hours of sleep each night.
Avoid tobacco, alcohol, or any substance abuse.
Remember to live your life fully and confidently.
If your symptoms persist after trying these strategies for four to six weeks, consider seeking medication options for short-term relief.
I hope this helps you find some relief. Let me know if you need further assistance.

Avoid water entering the said ear while bathing or swimming. We need to make sure there is no perforation of the drum. For the same, you must visit an ENT surgeon who can look into the ear through an otoscope. You can take an antihistaminic tablet to reduce fullness. It will help if the fullness is due to eustachian tube dysfunction caused due to pressure changes by suctioning. Do revert back if you need any support.

The most probable cause might be a flea or tick bite from your pets scar. In the chronological order of images provided, the insect bite reaction lesion, although it has healed but has turned into dermatitis or inflamed skin where there was a previous trauma. They usually present as redness, thick skin or plaque, itching, sometimes oozing secretions, pain, burning sensation, and discomfort. They are usually reduced with treatment. Eczema also may be accompanied by underlying allergic conditions like bronchial asthma and allergic rhinitis sneezing and running nose, especially during mornings, on exposure to dust or cold, etc..
I suggest
1. Mometasone and Fusidic acid cream Momate F or Etasone F to be used once daily at night in a very thin layer in a small quantity on the affected areas only for two weeks. This is a strong medication and, therefore, may be used in small quantities and may be continued for two weeks each time with a two-week break in between. They help with reducing inflammation and redness and preventing secondary bacterial infection. The brand with the combination mentioned above may be purchased, or the brand name mentioned along with the same may also be available.
2. Tablet Cetirizine 10 mg one hour before going to sleep at night for two weeks. They help with reducing itching and inflammation. It is advised not to drive or go out after consuming the tablet at night as it may be sedative.
3. Aquaphor Sodium chloride and water ointment is to be applied on the affected area two times a day for at least four weeks. They may be available online easily as well.
4. Capsule Omega 3 once daily at night after food for one month to promote hydration.
5. Tablet Ascorbic acid 500 mg to be taken after breakfast for faster healing of the current lesions. They help in strengthening immunity as well. I would like to advise you to kindly avoid milk and extremely hot food and drinks 30 minutes before and 30 minutes after the intake of the medication.
6. Ketoconazole two percent cream in the morning on the affected areas only for four weeks. This may be helpful in preventing fungal infections.
7. Oilatum liquid Paraffin and water soap for bathing. Mix the soap with water and apply the water on the affected area, leave for two minutes and wash off.
8. Lukewarm salt water may also be used to wash the affected area once daily. It is very helpful in reducing inflammation and preventing secondary infection.
Hope the details provided above were informative and did provide clarity.
Kindly revert back in case of further queries, and I would be glad to help.
Hope I could be of help.
Stay happy, healthy, and safe.
Get well soon. Take care.

"Hello doctor,
My son has a small bleeding cut and soon after that, he shook hands with an African guy who may or may not be having any wounds as he works in a restaurant. After two and a half weeks my son suffers from fever, cough, and sore throat. I am suspecting it can be a primary infection of HIV Human Immunodeficiency Virus from that African guy. Please help me know if these are the signs of HIV infection in my son.
Thank you very much.","Hello,
I am here to offer my professional insight into your medical issues. The chances of transmission of HIV human immunodeficiency virus by shaking hands are nil. The probability of the African guy having a bleeding wound that can infect your son is very unlikely. Such cases have not been reported. Kindly do not worry and forget the episode. The symptoms are non-specific and may not be due to HIV. It can be due to any respiratory infection.

"Hi doctor,
I noticed redness on the penis head. It is not how it normally looks, but I have noticed this happening a few times over the last few months. In both cases, when I noticed it, I have been on or recently on Isotretinoin low dosage treatment, and I do not know if this has any relevance. Of other issues, I suffer from what doctors believe are muscle issues in my pelvic floor, which leads to soreness in the perineum after sex. This is another issue and not correlated directly to this issue though.
I do not feel any itching or pain associated with this. I believe the other times I had this, it went away after some days, but I do not know what is causing it. I only noticed it because my foreskin and urethra were slightly red than usual when I went to pee.
Please see the photos to easily see what I mean. Hopefully, someone can explain to me what this is. The last time I had it and went to my dermatologist, it had subsided before, and she saw nothing wrong with it, but now it is back. I masturbated a few hours prior and do not know if this is relevant. Also, I have been tested for everything recently regarding STDs, and I am clean and have had no sex in that time.
Thank you.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
The most common cause of such rashes is candida infection. It can happen post-sex due to high blood sugar, low immunity,  or poor hygiene. You can confirm it by doing a KOH test.
Treatment for it would be Ketoconazole 2  cream twice a day for two weeks.

"Hi doctor,
My wife is feeling unwell. She has chest and body pain after recovering from the COVID-19 infection. Two years before she got dengue. Please help.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I went through your query about chest and body pain after COVID-19 coronavirus disease 2019. After recovering from COVID-19 illness, body pain could be due to various reasons like general weakness or myalgia due to inflammatory markers during viral infection. And it is not a significant problem to worry. But chest pain post-COVID-19 should not be ignored unless evaluated. During or after recovering from COVID-19 disease, the blood will be in a hypercoagulable state that leads to clot formation. Hence the person is prone to a heart attack or blood clot in any other bodys vessels. Therefore we should consider her symptoms of chest pain and rule out any significant issues. I would like to know some more details about her chest pain. What is the exact location of her chest pain? Is it continuous or intermittent? Does it occur at rest or during exertion and walking? What is the nature of her chest pain - is it squeezing, heaviness, pressure, pin-prick type, burning, or dull aching type? Does the pain increase while pressing over it with the hand? Do you have any recent cardiac investigations done? If yes, please share reports. How severe was her COVID-19 disease, and what was her D-dimer and other levels?

What is the worst thing that can happen if a small ant crawls into the human body through the nose or ear?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
The worst thing that can happen to that creature is that it will die. No insect after entering into the nose can survive for a long time as it usually gets pushed into the stomach and gets killed due to gastric juices. Yes, some organisms like worms survive the effect of gastric juices and can survive at the cost of the body. An insect in the nose usually, if alive, can produce severe foreign body sensations, and you would either sneeze it out or, if stuck, seek immediate medical help to get it out. Once an insect goes into the nose or ear, the feeling that it is still there is often psychological, even when the insect would not be there.","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 5, 'transparency': 8}","{'score': 96, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 86, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 8}"

Welcome to icliniq.com.
It seems you do have allergy tendencies in your body which are associated with asthma or allergic bronchitis and high IgE levels. Also you have associated skin issues like urticaria or atopic dermatitis which are all  connected together.
Well, the first line is usually anti-allergics and that too for a long time. I will not suggest Montelukast. Take Allegra 180 mg Fexofenadine and Levocet 10 mg Levocetirizine in the morning. If not controlled we can add Atarax Hydroxyzine. The key is to suppress the allergic cell release. If not controlled you may need a short course of steroids. Steroids work like magic in these diseases, but it is bound to relapse once you stop it. So, we have to control it with all three generations of different antihistamines. These conditions tend to fade off when you reach mid 20s. At times they linger on. We have to just wait and see.

Relax and do not worry. After circumcision, you will not have any skin on your penis head. If you pull also, it will go back to the ring of the penis head. So, that is normal.

Thanks.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Right flank pain has many different causes like ureteric colic, primarily due to stone in the ureter blocking the kidney, back pain due to compression of the spinal nerve root, and muscular pain. Firstly your ultrasound and urine test shows that there is no issue with your kidney or ureter attachments removed to protect the patients identity. Also, stabbing pain is not due to the kidney as kidney pain is grappling colicky pain. In addition, kidney pain does not aggravate with movement, while nerve and muscular pain aggravate upon any physical activity. So this pain is either muscular or nerve pain. For further workup, you will need an X-ray of the lumbosacral spine with supine and lateral views and a follow-up with an orthopedician or neurosurgeon. If you have any more queries, please do not hesitate to ask.

"Hi doctor,
I was exposed to a needlestick injury around ten weeks ago, and I ran a series of tests out of fear. They are as follows
1 HIV human immunodeficiency virus combination test - Non-reactive.
2 HbsAg hepatitis B surface antigen test - Non-reactive.
3 HCV hepatitis C virus test was positive. Following that, additional testing was done, and HCV viral load was not detected.
One month back, I did a basic health check-up that included infectious disease tests, and all were non-reactive.
Are these tests conclusive for both HIV and hepatitis B?
And my HbsAb hepatitis B surface antibody is below 10 IUml, which means I am non-immune and will take my booster dose.
I need your advice for the conclusion.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I read your query and can understand your concern.
The laboratory tests you took are negative for viral illnesses possibly transmitted by needle stick injury, primarily HIV human immunodeficiency virus. However, it is a good idea to keep getting tested yearly.
Other STDs sexually transmitted diseases, for example, bacterial infections such as treponema pallidum and syphilis, are transmitted via a sexual mode of transmission. You have undertaken this test as well.
Did you also have unprotected sexual exposure? If not, you need not have undertaken this particular test.
HbsAg antigen testing could also have been done to know a possible hepatitis B transmission. Kindly do it before you go for a booster dose.
Kindly share the hepatitis B antibody test report, which you have undertaken since you have mentioned it but not shared the report.
Are you a healthcare professional considering you have a needlestick injury?
The risk of HIV transmission with needlestick injury is very low and has less scientific evidence. Please keep this in mind the next time you have similar exposure, such as needlestick injury or unprotected sexual exposure. In such exposure situations, as per HIV guidelines, post-exposure HIV prophylaxis with three-drug therapy started within 72 hours of needle stick injury should have been undertaken by a qualified physician, infectious diseases, or public health physician.
Are you likely to have a possible risk of further exposure? If so, kindly visit your local HIV, infectious disease, internal medicine, or public health physician for being under pre-exposure prophylaxis with two drugs example TAF- Emtricitabine or TDF- Emtricitabine therapy. Also, please keep getting the HIV tests done yearly since the virus may be dormant for many years in rare cases.
Yes, HIV and HbsAg antigen and anti-hepatitis B antibodies are non-reactive and do not suggest detecting either virus. It would have been ideal to have Hep A hepatitis A antibody and HCV hepatitis C virus antibody titers for hepatitis A and hepatitis C, respectively.
The rate of occupational transmission from the blood of an HIV-positive source is believed to be 0.3  for exposure via skin and 0.09  for a mucous membrane nose, eye, mouth.
Exposure to intact skin is at no risk of transmission if removed in a timely fashion via washing.
The transmission rate from a hepatitis B positive source to a non-immunized host is 6  to 24 , and 1  to 8  for exposure to hepatitis C. Hepatitis B infectivity depends on the hepatitis B e antigen HBeAg status of the source. If HBeAg is positive, the transmission rate can be up to 30 , but when negative, it is 1  to 6 .
As per updated guidelines for the management of needlestick injury, the following needs to be done
HIV testing.
Hepatitis B antigen.
Hepatitis C antibody.
Aspartate aminotransferase AST and alanine aminotransferase ALT levels.
Alkaline phosphatase levels.
The variety and frequency of tests are as follows in case of continuous exposure
HIV testing at the time of the incident and again at six weeks, three months, six months, and once every year.
Hepatitis C antibody at the time of the incident and again at two weeks, four weeks, and eight weeks.
Hepatitis B surface antibody once before starting any prophylaxis.
Hepatitis B surface antigen - Immediate and once every year.
Hematology- Before starting any prophylaxis, complete blood count with differential counts and platelets and ESR erythrocyte sedimentation rate every year.
Blood biochemistry- Once every year, serum creatinine or BUN blood urea nitrogen levels, urinalysis with microscopic analysis of AST and ALT levels, alkaline phosphatase level, and total bilirubin level.

When I stopped it, I cannot able to move or walk and also my saturation at rest falls to 75 without oxygen concentrator. But, it rises to 99 on oxygen concentrator.

Welcome to icliniq.com. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis or HP is a type of interstitial lung disease. It is a chronic type of lung disease and treatment usually runs longer, especially with steroids and immunosuppressive drugs. As you said, you are taking steroids in tapering dose but still you are not able to stop it completely. So, there can be two possibilities. One is a recurrence of the underlying disease and the second is the possibility of another disease like lung fibrosis. Though you are taking steroids chronically, still it is inadequate if you are suffering from lung fibrosis. After going through your computed tomography CT scan report attachment removed to protect patient identity, there are areas of lung distortion and honeycombing. This finding goes in favor of lung fibrosis. If it is so, then I advise you talk to your pulmonologist for the possibility of IPF idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Treatment can be optimized accordingly. As you said, you are dependent on oxygen and steroids you need to continue till the further diagnosis is confirmed. So, detailed discussion with your pulmonologist will guide you further. At last, I advise you to keep patience as it is a lifelong disease and perfect diagnosis is must before starting any new medicines.

He had them done again three years before and were still slightly elevated though there was no dramatic increase. Now, he had them done again, and WBC was again elevated 10.3. He had them repeated recently, and WBC was 13,000. I am wondering what the likelihood of it being CML or other leukemia is. He got a new tattoo a couple of days before the most recent blood test.

"Hello doctor,
Do you have experience with FAS or FASD? Can prenatal exposure to alcohol cause a short columella? Is this common in those with the affected face?","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
We do see cases of fetal alcohol syndrome or fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Alcohol is a known teratogen for the human fetus. Consumption of alcohol during pregnancy is associated with abnormalities in the fetus. The problems can occur in many systems, most importantly facial changes, heart abnormalities, kidney abnormalities, and neurological structural or functional abnormalities.
Three findings are common in facial abnormalities
1. Smooth philtrum a groove seen from the bottom of the nose to the upper lip will look flat.
2. Thin upper lip.
3. Narrow palpebral fissures of the eyes.
Short columella can be an associated feature, but that alone cannot be used to label the diagnosis as fetal alcohol syndrome.","{'score': 97, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 94, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I can understand your concern and will surely help you. You have made an intelligent choice to take the emergency contraceptive pill within five hours since you wanted to prevent unplanned pregnancy. Further, the bleeding you experienced was most likely the withdrawal bleeding. The pregnancy test has already come negative, so not to worry about that aspect. Now I would like to tell you that emergency contraceptive pills are hormones based, and they have this known side effect of delaying periods in particular females. So you may expect a delay of up to two weeks for your next period. But do not worry about that and do not be stressed out because stress is the cause of delay in periods of 25 percent of females worldwide.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern. I have carefully reviewed the picture attachments removed to protect patients identity you sent. The area of concern appears to be a tonsillar stone, which is a calcification of food debris that becomes lodged in the tonsillar crevices. This is not a serious issue that you should worry about. In some cases, individuals might experience bad breath, a condition known as halitosis. If this has been bothering you significantly, your ENT ear, nose, and throat surgeon can gently remove it. I am confident that there is no need for you to worry, and it is not related to any cancer or malignancy. To prevent further deposits after removal, I recommend performing salt water gargles five to six times a day for a month, particularly after meals. Additionally, try to minimize the consumption of oily foods to prevent recurrence.

"Hello doctor,I would like to know if I should see a doctor soon. A week ago, I scraped my elbow on a rusty piece of fence. I believe I am vaccinated against tetanus, so I cleaned the wound and put a plaster on it. I was fine for like five days. I began getting a runny nose two days later. My muscles began becoming more and more tense, especially in the legs. It is now around 11 days, and it has gotten much worse. I am more clammy and sweaty, the pain has increased, and I keep getting random sharp pains across my body.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I thoroughly read your query and understand your concern.
I can try to provide some general information. If you are experiencing increasing symptoms such as muscle tension, increased pain, random sharp pains, and feeling clammy or sweaty, it could be a good idea to see a doctor for a proper evaluation. While tetanus is rare, it can be a serious infection that can occur from rusty or dirty objects. Even if you believe you are vaccinated against tetanus, it is still possible to contract the infection in certain circumstances. Treatment for wounds typically involves the following steps
1. Cleanliness Before treating a wound, it is important to ensure proper hygiene. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water, or use hand sanitizer to reduce the risk of infection. Wear disposable gloves if available.
2. Control bleeding If the wound is actively bleeding, apply gentle pressure with a clean cloth or sterile gauze pad to stop the bleeding. Elevate the injured area if possible.
3. Clean the wound Rinse the wound gently with clean water to remove any dirt, debris, or bacteria. Avoid using harsh antiseptics like hydrogen peroxide or iodine, as they can damage healthy tissues. Use a mild soap if necessary.
4. Apply an antiseptic Once the wound is clean, you can apply an over-the-counter antiseptic solution or ointment, such as povidone-iodine or hydrogen peroxide, to help prevent infection. Follow the instructions on the product packaging for proper application.
5. Cover the wound Protect the wound by applying a sterile adhesive bandage, sterile gauze, or non-stick dressing. This helps prevent further contamination and promotes healing. Change the dressing regularly or whenever it becomes wet or dirty.
6. Pain management If the wound is painful, over-the-counter pain relievers like Acetaminophen Tylenol or Ibuprofen Advil, Motrin can be taken according to the recommended dosage. Follow the instructions on the packaging or consult a healthcare professional.
7. Watch for signs of infection Monitor the wound for signs of infection, such as increased pain, redness, swelling, warmth, pus, or fever. If these symptoms develop or worsen, seek medical attention.
I feel you might have an infection for which the antibiotic should be started.
Hope this addresses your concern.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
If it is due to your periods, then this soreness and discomfort are not a problem. This could be because of hormonal changes and nothing else. Also, get a urine pregnancy test done with an early morning urine sample to ensure that you are not pregnant. Usually, these symptoms are more common when you are in the early stages of pregnancy.
Avoid touching breasts more frequently.
Wear cotton innerwear and loosen it up.
If the pain becomes severe, then visit doctor and get yourself checked. Do get back to me with reports so that I can guide you further.

"Hello doctor,
I am an 18-year-old female suffering from hair loss receding hairline. I think it is genetic because my mother also has less hair and has the same pattern of hair loss.
Please let me know. I am concerned about my hair loss.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I read your query and can understand your concern.
With your description, I suppose you have androgenetic alopecia, also called female pattern hairloss. This is a progressive genetic condition. We can try to slow down hair loss with medications. Treatment depends on the grade of hairloss. I suggest you attach your clinical picture along with your query so that it is convenient for me to comment on your condition and suggest proper medications. I would recommend you consult a specialist and take consent before taking these medications
1. Minoxidil solution or spray is available in 2 , 5 , and 10 . The concentration depends on grading. I cannot be specific with the percentage of Minoxidil as I have not assessed your grade of hairloss. This is a long-term treatment, and you may need to use it for years.
2. Multivitamin hair nutrients contain biotin, calcium, and zinc.
3. Monolaurin-containing shampoo can be used to wash your scalp on alternate days.
Now coming to the nonmedications part, which is equally important
1. Always use lukewarm water to wash your hair, never hot water.
2. Do not comb your hair when it is wet.
3. Use a comb that has a wide space between each tooth, and the tip of the tooth should be blunt so that it does not irritate the scalp.
4. Avoid using hair dryers and straighteners.
5. Eat protein-rich food, egg, chicken, milk, curd, and lentils. Hair is made up of a protein called keratin.
6. Exercise daily for 40 minutes at least six days a week. This is to keep hormone levels balanced, as androgenetic alopecia also has a hormonal influence.

"Hi doctor,
I am having frequent stools three to four times for the last three days. It was not watery but a small amount in solid. I took tablet Cifran CT once daily to control frequent stools for the past three days. I find once medicine power diminishes in 24 hours, and the frequent stools start again. My wife, who is staying with me, also had frequent stools for the last three days, but the stools were not watery.
I had a fever of 99 degree Fahrenheit on the first day and took Paracetamol. I was feeling feverish on the second day, but the thermometer showed 97.6 F. I retook Paracetamol, and it reduced the body temperature, and I feel better. I am also feeling weak for the last three days. I have been testing oxygen level during the previous three days, and it is consistently above 95. I also do not have any breathing problems so far. My wife is also having slight weakness but no fever.
I am worried if this can be COVID since that can also cause frequent stools. We both had the Covishield vaccine 13 days ago. I was taking medication for pulmonary tuberculosis two years back and currently undergoing medication for suspecting bone TB.
Is there any chance I am having COVID? Can COVID cause frequent stool like this? Whether tablet Cifran CT is acceptable, or will you suggest any other medicine for frequent stools? What are some drugs that I can start to prevent complications of COVID? These are some queries that I need your help with.
I am looking forward to your reply.
Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
It seems that you are worried.
Let me answer your queries.
Yes. There is a possibility that you have COVID-19. The COVID-19 vaccine does not give 100 protection. However, it reduces the severity of infection. Yes, the frequent stools is a symptom of COVID. Tablet Cifran CT Ciprofloxacin and Tinidazole is a good medicine for diarrhea. But it is to be used twice daily. Otherwise, it becomes useless, and next time it may turn ineffective. However, if your diarrhea is due to COVID, this medicine is inefficient as it has nothing to do with viral disease. Still, COVID associated diarrhea is self-limiting. You can take ORS oral rehydration therapy as required. Keep hydrated. If diarrhea is profuse, take tablet Racecadotril 100 mg thrice daily. Do not take if episodes are less than five to six per day.
Since both of you are affected, it can be COVID, food poisoning, or typhoid as well. Do RT-PCR reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, CBC complete blood count, stool routine examination in that order. If RT-PCR is positive, need not proceed with the further tests. Nothing much to do. If fever persists for more than five days and oxygen dips, you need immediate medical attention. Otherwise, all will settle down.
Take symptomatic medicine like tablet Paracetamol.

Thanks for your query. Common medical conditions that can lead to weight gain in spite of proper diet and exercise are thyroid disorders, polycystic ovarian syndrome and Cushings syndrome and certain medicines. Since you are on Thyroxine and your thyroid is under control then thyroid is not causing weight gain.
PCOS is not encountered at your age group generally. Cushing syndrome causes hormonal imbalance leading to weight gain and a few other symptoms. You can be investigated on the lines of Cushing syndrome which includes 24-hour urinary free cortisol test, midnight plasma cortisol, and late-night salivary cortisol measurements and low-dose Dexamethasone suppression test LDDST.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have read the query, and I can understand your concern.
You have balanoposthitis with balanitis. Balanitis is inflammation of the glans penis. Balanitis involving the foreskin and prepuce is termed balanoposthitis. Predisposing factors include poor hygiene and overwashing, use of over-the-counter medications, and nonretraction of the foreskin. It may be associated with diabetes and candidal or fungal infections. Recommended investigations are assessment of blood sugar level and KOH potassium hydroxide preparation mount for candidiasis. I suggest you gently clean the penis and foreskin every day by softly retracting the foreskin and soaking them in warm water. Also, you can use a combination of Fusidic acid and Clotrimazole twice daily for one month. If balanitis does not respond to topical therapy, take Ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily for two weeks. Consult a specialist doctor, talk to them, and then take the medication. Please get a review with a picture for better evaluation and the best possible treatment for your concern.

What are the side effects that we should be aware of? Will her health issue be resolved by using this medication?
Kindly help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Thanks for briefing me regarding the problem of concern.
I read your query and can understand your concern.
When Clonazepam is used consistently to treat seizures, tolerance, dependency, and symptoms of withdrawal may occur. When a medication loses its effectiveness over time and needs increasing doses to have the same beneficial effect, this is known as tolerance. Dependence refers to the physical and psychological need for the medication to prevent seizures, and withdrawal symptoms may occur if the medication is suddenly stopped or reduced.
Nasal spray Diazepam is a newer medication for the treatment of seizures associated with epilepsy in adults. It is a modified form of tablet Diazepam, which is also used to treat seizures. Diazepam is administered intravenously IV and is typically used for the short-term management of seizures that are not controlled by other medications or can not be managed orally due to vomiting or other factors.
While Diazepam may be effective in managing seizures, it should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare provider who can monitor the use and manage any potential side effects or complications. Some potential side effects of Diazepam include drowsiness, confusion, and respiratory depression, particularly at higher doses. It should be used with caution in older adults and people with respiratory or liver problems. It is important to understand that while medication can help manage seizure symptoms, it is also important to address any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to the seizures, such as head trauma, brain tumors, or other neurological disorders. A comprehensive treatment approach that includes medication, lifestyle changes, and support from family and friends may be beneficial for managing seizure symptoms and improving overall health and well-being. Your aunts physician can provide more detailed information about the potential benefits and risks of Diazepam for her specific condition and can help develop a personalized treatment plan that meets.

I hope I have answered your question.

"Hello doctor,
Can you please give me answers to the following questions, please? After having sex for the first time, is there a way to speed up the cure and stop bleeding of the hymen? How should the bleeding part be cleaned and with what? How do I know that the hymen is totally restored or cured? How long should I wait for the next intimate relationship? Thank you.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
The bleeding should stop on its own. Clean with only plain water. If bleeding continues for more than one or two days, then consult a nearby gynecologist, you may require some medicines or even a stitch to stop bleeding. Once defloration happens, then hymen cannot be intact. Pain and bleeding should stop on its own within two days maximum. Do not have sex for at least 20 to 30 days. And after that also, do not have rough sex and use lubricating gel for some time. The hymen will not restore and remain torn, and some remnants will be seen as the time passes.","{'score': 88, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 8}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hi doctor,
My sister-in-law is 3 months pregnant. Three days ago, during her antenatal scan, we came to know that it is a monozygotic twin pregnancy. We have a few questions. How to know that it is not a conjoined twin? I have attached the scan reports. Please let us know whether the growth is fine. It was found to be a twin only after 3 months. Will it cause any major difference in their growth? Also, she is a short person and 83 lbs weight. Also, she lost 6 lbs in the last three months due to pregnancy sickness. Will it lead to premature delivery or C-section? She does not have any health issue such as BP, thyroid, bleeding disorder, diabetes, etc. This is her pregnancy and I have attached the scan reports for your reference. Please guide us doctor.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Firstly, my hearty congratulations for twin pregnancy.
I have gone through the reports attachment removed to protect patient identity and they are perfectly fine. There are no signs of conjoined twins. NT nuchal translucency is normal and both nasal bones are seen. Heartbeat and growth is perfectly corresponding to the dates. Placenta has no problem and doppler flows are normal.Though twin pregnancy has to be looked a little carefully, but not all twin pregnancies have complications. A little extra care, repeated hospital visit and more frequent scans will definitely help you take necessary precautions. It is too very early to say things in detail, but as far as the scan goes it is perfectly fine. However, in the eventual scan all the details will be revealed.
Regarding growth of the twins, the grow scan will reveal the details and at this point of time the scan is perfect. Regarding mothers weight, usually in the initial three months most of the pregnant women loses weight and is not a matter of concern, until she has heavy vomiting. Twin pregnancy has many risk factors, including prematurity, but regular gynecologist visits, proper medications and health care measures will take care of the problem. Regarding C-section, most of the twin pregnancy will end up with a cesarean section, mainly because of the babys outcome rather than a complication. Twin pregnancy comes with double responsibility, but not double stress. Just take care of her. Regular gynecologist visits, regular scan and tests will help any type of complications. You need not have to take so much pressure, as the pregnancy at this point is perfect and healthy. Ask her to continue with Iron and Calcium supplements.","{'score': 93, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hi doctor,I suffered a back injury at work nine months ago while lifting an order of 20 batteries weighing 44 pounds each. When I lifted the last battery of the order, I felt a sharp pain in my lower back and my left leg that made me collapse, and I was rushed to the hospital. I have seen a number of doctors over the last nine months without any improvement. I was diagnosed with an L5S1 broad annular tear, a paracentral disc bulge, compression of the exiting nerve canal, and a swollen S1 nerve root. Symptoms that have occurred since my injuries are bladder issues dribbling, unable to stop peeing and leaking during the night in bed, muscle spasms leaving indents in my lower back, redness in my left foot photo attached, muscle twitching in the left thigh, calf, and big toe, left big toe and two other toes sticking up with pain, a swollen Achilles tendon, a swollen foot, and lower back pain radiating to the left leg. The treatment I underwent since the injury was a nerve-blocking injection in the L5S1, nine weeks of physiotherapy and hydrotherapy, and three months of a medication program that included Endone 5 mg twice a day and Gabapentin 100 mg twice a day. My doctor suggested L5S1 disc replacement surgery. I would like to get your opinion on the treatment. I have attached some MRI scans and photos.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Firstly, I would suggest you undergo endoscopic or microsurgical discectomy surgery for your back pain as soon as possible without further delay. You can also consider disc replacement as an option. Regarding your symptoms, I would like to tell you that we human beings have jelly-like material disc between the spine bones vertebra. They act as shock absorbers. But as you lifted quite a bit of weight, there was significantly increased pressure in the disc, so the covering of the disc annulus fibrosus ruptured and inner material of the disc came out. This is causing pressure on the nerve or nerves which are coming from spinal cord towards leg and causing all of your symptoms. Another important thing is weight reduction and activity modification. Both are risk factors for disc prolapse which you have. So even after surgery to prevent recurrence at other levels, you need to reduce weight. You should not lift a heavy weight or bend your back in front. For the redness in your left foot, I wanted to ask since when have you developed this problem. Do you have a fever or other symptoms which suggest infection?","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"

Welcome to icliniq.com.
The way you describe your headaches they do not sound like a migraine. so I guess most probably migraines can be ruled out. the headache that you are describing looks more like a tension-type headache which is usually on both sides, around the temples. these headaches are very nonspecific and tend to occur in type-a personality people, people who stress a lot, etc. They are usually cured with basic analgesics and there is no permanent cure for them. I would advise you to try analgesics for the headaches if they occur. if they are very severe and difficult to tolerate then we can try stronger medication.

"Hello doctor,
I recently had a massage with an unknown man. He gave me a massage that turned sexual. He masturbated me. I touched his penis and testicles. Then played with his nipples after that, I do not remember him pre-cumming. After playing with his penis and testicles, I played with his nipples and nibbled on them no blood as I checked with him. I also licked his nipple. I tasted massage lotion on my mouth or tongue and on my lips afterward. He then shared that he is HIV human immunodeficiency virus positive which is undetectable and on medication. I stopped then. My concern is that I had a two to three-day-old canker sore from biting my lip. Now I am scared that my hand with massage lotion may have transferred his body fluid to his nipples that I nibbled on and licked with a canker sore on my lip. I know that a canker sore is not open to the bloodstream. I also have gingivitis but did not brush my teeth for many hours before. Does this represent a risk and, if so how much of a risk and should I get tested? If a risk, how is it a risk?
Please help me.","Hi, Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have gone through your query. The situation that you described does not come under high risk, even though the person is known as HIV human immunodeficiency virus positive. Oral sex itself has negligible risk when compared to normal sex while licking alone is not classified as a risk. There is not much to worry about in your case as you have not been in direct contact with his body fluids. But it is always advisable to get yourself tested as diseases such as hepatitis B and C can transmit through such modes. I hope I clarified your doubt. If any concerns consult me at icliniq.com.

You should be aware that chance of pregnancy is there in every cycle, but in which cycle you will be pregnant is not predictable. The more desperate you become, the stress will cause more delay and so relax. You have mentioned that all tests were normal. By chance if you have not done any of the following tests, please do it. Check the following blood tests Blood sugar PP postprandial, TSH thyroid stimulating hormone, prolactin, testosterone, Hb hemoglobin, TC total count, DC levels differential count, ultrasound of pelvis and your husbands  semen analysis. If all these are normal then HSG x-ray hysterosalpingogram to see the tubes. This you can do after six months of treatment.

The night only wear of retainers will not cause over eruption of wisdom teeth, as during daytime you will have a normal bite.

"Hello doctor,
I have been diagnosed with OCD. My OCD comes in the form of intense fear of sleep for the past five years, but it has gotten worse within the past couple of months. I am afraid the moment sleep comes, I fight this feeling until I am exhausted. How can I make peace with falling asleep and not associate it with fear and something to avoid? I am currently taking Gabapentin 600 mg, Seroquel 100 mg, and Clomipramine 25 mg. I have been on SSRI approximately 20 years back, for anxiety and depression.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I will start with the pharmacological part. You can discuss with your treating doctor regarding increasing the dose of Clomipramine, not only will it help with sleep but also in decreasing the obsessions. You can also discuss regarding substituting it with Fluvoxamine if not given a trial yet. Now a few points regarding non-pharmacological methods that can help with OCD obsessive-compulsive disorder are as follows. Practice patterned breathing exercises like Sudarshan Kriya daily, practice steps of sleep hygiene like sleeping and waking up at a regular time, avoiding caffeinated drinks at least eight hours before sleep, avoid using tv, mobile, laptop, etc. half an hour before sleep, instead do relaxing activities like taking a hot shower, after going to bed, do 4-5-8 pattern breathing that is, inhale for four seconds through the nose, hold breath for five seconds and then exhale via mouth for eight seconds. Repeat 4 to 5 such breathing cycles it will help you relax and sleep, BMI body mass index needs to be taken care. You can also take CBT cognitive behavioral therapy sessions with a psychotherapist. I know it is easier said than done but try to accept your obsession, but not the fear or anxiety associated with it. Logging down your obsessions sometimes helps relieve the associated anxiety.

I am eight weeks and three days pregnant. I have been spotting every day for almost two weeks. I have not been bleeding heavy or had any blood clots or tissues. I went for my USG three days back and they were unable to find any heartbeat. Kindly advise if we should still stay positive. I am worried.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have read your concern.
I know you are anxious but to be honest, the likelihood that this will be a miscarriage is very high. By at least six weeks, there should already be a heartbeat on the ultrasound. We usually give at least two more weeks to repeat the scan especially if it is from a spontaneous conception not an IVF pregnancy since the exact date of conception is not determined. If you have not had an ultrasound before this then I suggest you have another USG ultrasonography after two weeks. But if the age of gestation was already determined prior to this USG, then it is highly likely that this will result in what we call missed abortion.","{'score': 95, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 5, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

I am experiencing itching in my anus. I took a picture, but I am unsure about its significance. I am a 33-year-old male, single, and free from any diseases and drugs. I noticed a small growth in my anus, but I am uncertain whether it is a normal occurrence. Could it be hemorrhoid, fistula, or some other condition? All of my lab tests, including LFT, RFT, CBC, TFT, and FBS are normal. What could this be? Please help.
Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.I have reviewed the images that you have attached attachment removed to protect the patients identity. It appears that you are experiencing a condition known as Pruritus ani. I do not observe any visible signs of fistula or hemorrhoids. However, for a more definitive assessment, I suggest you schedule an in-person appointment with a surgeon. The peri-anal skin seems to be slightly macerated. To address your discomfort, consider the following measures
Sitz Bath Prepare a sitz bath by filling a medium-sized tub with lukewarm water. Add two teaspoons 2 x 0.17 ounces of ordinary salt per liter of water. Sit in this water and attempt to gently press around the anus. This will help cleanse and soothe the anal region. Perform this sitz bath for about 15 minutes, twice a day, for six to eight weeks.Incorporate a high-fiber diet into your meals.Adequate Fluid Intake Consume plenty of fluids, unless you have kidney or heart conditions. Aim for 0.52 to 0.79 gallons of water per day. Drink at regular intervals throughout the day.Wear loose-fitting cotton clothing, and make sure to change daily to maintain hygiene.Use soft toilet paper when cleaning the area. Avoid excessive rubbing or scrubbing.Refrain from consuming spicy foods, alcoholic beverages, coffee, tea, chocolate, and citrus juices for the next two months. Afterward, you can reintroduce these items one by one to see if any of them are associated with the itching.Regarding the specific statement you made, I noticed a small growth in my anus... I would appreciate it if you could provide more details. Furthermore, please follow up after one week. Additionally, let me know if anyone else in your family or among your roommates is experiencing a similar issue.Thanks and regards.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 89, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}"

"Hi doctor,
I would like to know if a man is considered safe if he receives a vaccination for rabies after eight months of a dog bite and completes all doses. Also, if the virus has already entered the spinal cord and was on its way to the brain but did not make it, will the vaccine still kill the virus?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern.
If your dog is still alive and healthy eight months after the scratch, there is no need for therapy. The dog would have perished by now if it had been infected with rabies a deadly virus spread to people from the saliva of infected animals. As a result, you do not require rabies immunization. The rabies virus enters the body by a nerve and goes to the spinal cord, then to the brain, where it multiplies. It then passes through additional nerves to the salivary glands and into the saliva. Rabies is usually fatal once the virus reaches the spinal cord and brain.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

"Hello doctor,
My second baby is going to be 5 months in a few days. For the past few days, we see small orange color stains in front side of his diaper probably coming out through urine. It is not coming always out of a few diapers that we change every day, a small stain is seen in one diaper and most probably around evening. On our recent visit to doctor he was 6.17 lbs and his birth weight was 6.17 lbs. He had a stomach infection three weeks back with mild fever and he was put on Cefixime by a doctor. He is visually doing well, active and smiling, and inline with milestones so far.
Does the condition warrant a urine or any other test? He had hyperbilirubinemia immediately upon birth due to ICT positive status of my wife and baby went through blood exchange transfusion on the second day of life and was in NICU for the first 10 days of life and recovered. He is currently on Vitcofol, Trifer, Pediawise, and Zincovit.","Hi,

Sometimes the baby can have excess uric acid crystals in the urine and can stain the diaper. I just want you to make sure it is not blood which I think it is not. If it is blood then after diaper dries it will turn dark. The color of uric acid is very typical. If you can send me a photo then I can say for sure.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern.
The probable diagnosis is post-T12 posterior stabilization. Resuming normal activity depends upon the exact surgery done, but usually, the patient can start walking the very next day of surgery. But make sure that you get up from the bed by laying on one side, then getting up sideways. This should not affect your sex life assuming the spinal cord is normal. Also, it should not affect the rest of your life if healing after surgery goes well.

Also, can I take post-exposure treatment at this stage? What are the good antirabies available?","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com. The indication for post-exposure vaccination with or without rabies immunoglobulin depends on the type of contact with the rabid animal. Types of contact are of three categories 1. Category I  Touching or feeding the animals and licks on the skin. 2. Category II - Nibbling of uncovered skin, minor scratches or abrasions without bleeding and licks on broken skin. 3. Category III  Single or multiple transdermal bites or scratches, contamination of mucous membrane with saliva from licks and exposure to bat bites or scratches. In your case, if the dog was rabid or you do not know the vaccination status of the dog, then you should get post-exposure prophylaxis. You probably fall into category 2. Your vaccination schedule should be one dose of the vaccine should be administered on days 0, 3, 7, 14 and 30.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have read your query and understand your concern.
I think you have seborrheic dermatitis. Hair look of uniform thickness all over, so at this moment it doesnt look like male pattern baldness MPB. In MPB there is gradual thinning of hair and you start noticing hair of various diameters. A mild reduction of hair volume can be seen and it can be because of seborrheic dermatitis as well. In any case along with the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis, you can apply Minoxidil foam, which will work in both MPB and hair loss due to seborrheic dermatitis. I suggest the following.
1. Candid-B lotion. Clotrimazole and Beclomethasone once at night.
2. Tugaine Minoxidil 5  foam once in the morning. Please use foam and not lotion or solution, or it might irritate seborrheic dermatitis.
3. Use Ketoconazole 2   shampoo on alternate days.
4. Tablet Levocetirizine 5 mg once at night or if itching is there.
5. Avoid using hair oil.

"Hello doctor,
I had unprotected sex and took a Plan B pill the next day. I had sex again and took another pill. Will I be fine?","Hi,
I am delighted to welcome you at icliniq.com.
I read your query and understand your concern.
The emergency pill is a high dose of progesterone hormone, the same hormone produced in your body in the second half of the menstrual cycle after ovulation. This pill suddenly increases the thickness of the inner lining of the uterus, making it unfavorable for a possible pregnancy to implant. As it is a single dose, it lacks the strength to stay in place, so it falls off, resulting in your period or bleeding from the increased thickness within 7 to 10 days of taking the pill. This bleeding will consist of thick, fleshy pieces that are dark red or brown, accompanied by slight lower abdominal pain until the bleeding significantly reduces. So, as you can see, the inner uterine lining becomes unfavorable after taking a single pill. It will also provide protection for your next sexual activity. Taking a second pill will not harm you. However, you may experience a delayed withdrawal bleed as your hormone levels would have risen after the repeat dose. The failure rates are high if you engage in sexual activity, take the pill, experience bleeding, and then have sex again before your next period, repeating the pill. This may disrupt your hormonal balance and regularity of periods, but it should not cause any other problems. You will be perfectly fine.
I hope I have clarified your query. Please feel free to write back if you have any more questions.

Erythromycin is a hepatic enzyme inhibitor meaning it will delay the metabolism of Lucette Ethinylestradiol and Drospirenone thus allowing increased levels of the hormone in the bloodstream for a longer duration than normal.

Sorry to hear about your breakup and the parents reaction to it. From the details you have given, this is a case of mild to moderate depression for which you need help.

Also, there is congestion in your pharyngeal wall, So infection leads to that inflammation leading to nodule formation. I would advise continue taking antibiotics and gargling with warm water and betadine. It will disappear in some time.
Please follow up for further assistances.

"Hello doctor,
I am 39-year-old, 5 feet 6 inches, 137 pounds, with high blood pressure. I had back surgery and was given three tablets of 30 mg Tylenol for pain. But still, they did not help resolve the pain, so I went to the emergency room, and they gave me Percocet 10 mg, but I had already taken the Tylenol 30 mg 12 hours ago. Can I take the Percocet 10 mg because I am in a lot of pain?
Kindly help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Thank you for your query.
You can take Percocet Acetaminophen and Oxycodone 10 mg now, but if possible, please have it after a meal. If the pain does not reduce, you can take a tablet of Diclofenac analgesic, NSAID - non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and antipyretic 50 mg and Metaxalone muscle relaxant 400 mg, but this should also be taken after a meal otherwise, it may cause acidity. Once your pain is relieved, please consult a physiotherapist. Please continue with your high blood pressure medications along with this medicine. I suggest you get MRI magnetic resonance imaging of thoracolumbar spine.
Kindly consult a specialist, talk with them and take the medications with their consent.

"Hi doctor,I increased my dose to 50 milligrams of Trazodone for sleep. During the night, I had a mild painful erection that I ignored. Then when I woke up, I still had a painful erection.

For the record, I have been on Trazodone 25 milligrams for three weeks. Last night I increased my dose to 50 milligrams, that one time caused that mild painful erection.

"Hi doctor,
Is it safe taking two I-pill in a week? Let there be little side effects. But will there be any chance of being pregnant even after that?
Thank you.","Hi,
Welcome back to icliniq.com.
I-pill is a high dose of Progesterone hormone, the same hormone produced in your body in the second half of the period after ovulation. This pill will suddenly increase the thickness of the inner lining of the uterus, making it unfavorable for a possible pregnancy to implant. As it is a single dose, it has no strength to stand on, so it falls off, and you get periods of bleeding from the increased thickness within 7 to 10 days of taking the pill. This bleeding will be thick, fleshy pieces, dark red or brown, with slight lower abdominal pain till the bleeding is reduced. So indirectly, there was no need for the second pill. When you take one tablet, the lining of the uterus is unfavorable, so it will stay till the next bleeding within 7 to 10 days. Because you took two tablets, the hormone levels will be further disturbed, so periods will be further delayed. But it is not fully safe to keep taking it in the same month. You can take alternative methods like condoms or birth control pills. For the time being, you are safe, and there is no chance of pregnancy unless you had sex after that two episodes.
Hope I have clarified your query, do write back if any more queries.

In the sexual relationship, the condom was broken, and I did not realize it. I am nervous even though I fulfilled the protocol. Should I start PEP as an additional measure? Please help.
Thank you.","Hi,
Thank you for stopping by
I am here to provide expert opinion on your medical issues.
The chances of transmission of HIV human immunodeficiency virus through single unprotected intercourse are low. Condom breakage can be considered almost as unprotected intercourse, though the risk in your scenario is very low. On-demand PrEP pre-exposure prophylaxis is quite effective, though not 100 percent effective in the prevention of HIV transmission. If the doses of PrEP have been taken as per protocol, the risk of transmission of HIV is almost nil. If the person is HIV-negative, for sure, there is no need for PEP post-exposure prophylaxis. There may not be a need for PEP with the given details. You can consult your doctor for further risk assessment and the need for PEP.
I hope this information will help you. In case of further queries, please revert.

"Hello doctor,
I am a 28-year-old male. I have diagnosed with anxiety and panic attacks and prescribed 5 mg of Xanax daily dose for eight years.

Someone told me that taking 5 mg Xanax daily for eight years is not even harming or benefiting the system because my system got used to it and because it is a low dose. Is that right?","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Xanax 0.5 mg dose is not high. The drug is a rapid action Benzodiazepine drug and helps to reduce the anxiety symptoms. Abrupt stoppage of a drug after regularly taking for years might lead to withdrawal symptoms and precipitation of panic and insomnia. So it is advisable to reduce the dose of the drug slowly over about four weeks. Gradual dose reduction would not cause withdrawal symptoms. Reduce the doses by about 25  every second week, and this will prevent the withdrawal symptoms. The drug is safe to use and can be used for long but should be used under regular supervision of a doctor only.","{'score': 94, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

You must not touch the wound with anything and allow the wound to heal for a week. In dry socket condition, you will have severe pain, and a foul smell would come due to infection inside the wound and loss of whole blood clot. Use warm salt water gargle twice a day for a week, and it helps prevent infection and faster healing.

Your history prompts me to go through further questions. Do you have a regular menstrual cycle? Any hair growth on the face, arms which is unusual than before? Scanty periods can mean oligomenorrhea the medical term for decreased blood flow. Weight gain, hair growth, and oligomenorrhea are typical symptoms of a condition called PCOD polycystic ovarian syndrome which happens in girls, and multiple cysts are present in ovaries, and this leads to these symptoms.

Do not be stressed, I am here to help.
According to your history, you have not got periods this month and you are having some abnormal discharge. I saw the picture. attachment removed to protect patient identity. My first suggestion would be to do get a urine pregnancy test. I understand that you have used emergency contraceptive but sometimes it fails. We need to know whether you have a pregnancy in which cases sometime the discharge is of nature as you described. You may be in the process of a miscarriage. If this is negative, then the next step would be to get a pelvic ultrasound done because the discharge seems unusual. But let me assure you that there are more chances of you having a miscarriage due to the failure of emergency contraceptives.
In case your urine pregnancy test is positive you need to take proper treatment like pregnancy termination kits or Misoprostol tablets depending on the condition of the conceptus baby at this time. In case your pregnancy test is negative you need a pap smear, ultrasound, and biopsy of the tissue you are discharging. Whatever it is, it can be managed properly if it is addressed on time. There is no need for panic. Please follow up with your pregnancy test results.

2 When can I expect my periods?
3 Does spotting after six days of taking tablet I-pill mean no pregnancy?

I understand your concern,
Bleeding or spotting after taking tablet I-pill is a side effect, as I-pill contains synthetic progesterone, which causes hormonal imbalance and prevents pregnancy. This hormonal imbalance can cause side effects like spotting, irregular bleeding, bloating, nausea, vomiting, and delayed periods. These side effects vary in individuals and may present as a combination of symptoms or just as one of them. The answer to your questions
1 Spotting or bleeding is a normal side effect of I-pill, which occurs in some individuals. There is nothing to worry about. It will stop on its own.
2 There may be a slight delay less than 15 days  in your regular periods due to the pill, or it may occur on your regular period time. If there is a delay of more than 15 days, kindly do a pregnancy test.
3 Bleeding or spotting is not an indicator of whether the pill has worked or not. Only your next regular period is an indicator.

"Hi doctor,Please let me know the natural sources of caffeine. Are cocoa beans, tea, yerba mate, guarana, and so on the natural sources? What is caffeine and what effect does caffeine have on our body? Further, I would like to know how much caffeine is contained in a serving, and what are the associated benefits and risks of consuming caffeine. What foods contain caffeine and what is the best way to incorporate it into the diet? Kindly help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I warmly welcome you to the expert medical opinion platform.
Caffeine is a naturally occurring alkaloid in about 60 plant species. Of these, cocoa beans, kola nuts, tea leaves, and coffee beans are the most well-known sources of caffeine. Other natural sources of caffeine include yerba mat, guarana berries, guayusa, and the yaupon holly. Caffeine can have both positive and negative health effects. It can treat and prevent premature infant breathing disorders like bronchopulmonary dysplasia of prematurity and apnea of prematurity.
Caffeine citrate is on the WHO World Health Organization model list of essential medicines. It may confer a modest protective effect against some diseases, including Parkinsons disease, and certain types of cancer. One meta-analysis concluded that cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease and stroke are less likely to occur if one takes three to five cups of non-decaffeinated coffee a day but is more likely to occur if one takes over five cups a day.
Some people experience insomnia or sleep disruption if they consume caffeine, especially during the evening hours, but others show little disturbance. Evidence of a risk during pregnancy is equivocal some authorities recommend that pregnant women should limit consumption to about two cups of coffee per day or even less. Caffeine can produce a mild form of drug dependence which can be associated with withdrawal symptoms like sleepiness, headache, and irritability when an individual stops taking caffeine after repeated daily intake. Tolerance to the autonomic effects of increased blood pressure and heart rate, and increased urine output, develops with chronic use that is, these symptoms become less pronounced or do not occur following consistent use of caffeine.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I can understand your concern.
Alcohol affects every organ in the body. It is known as a central nervous system depressant, and it is rapidly absorbed from the stomach and small intestine into the bloodstream. Metabolism occurs in the liver. However, the liver can only metabolize a small amount of alcohol at a time, leaving the excess to circulate throughout the body. The intensity of the effect of alcohol on the body is directly related to the amount consumed. Individual reactions to alcohol vary and are influenced by many factors, including but not limited to age, gender, race, physical condition, amount of food consumed before drinking, use of medications or drugs, and family history of alcohol problems. Alcohol consumption and tolerance to loud noise is a well-observed phenomenon as seen in the Western world where parties get noisier by the hour as the evening matures. This leads to an increase in the referrals to the hearing aid clinic and the diagnosis of cocktail party deafness which may not necessarily be only due to presbycusis or noise-induced hearing loss. The effect of alcohol on hearing was also found to be reversible in the short term.

Also, I have intermittent pain in lower left abdominal area. I do not see my Hematologist for follow up until next month and cannot start Remicade until I get it figured out.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Thank you for providing a detailed history.
To answer your first query, there is no direct correlation between fluctuating BP and the increase in cell counts. CRP is usually elevated in RA rheumatoid arthritis disease, which is a common finding reflecting the bodys reaction to inflammatory or autoimmune disorders like RA. Though your BP is now controlled to some extent, the low pulse rate could be because of Bystolic 5 mg Nebivolol. You need a review with your Cardiologist for the same.
Also, looking at your non-specific symptoms like weakness, fatigue, intermittent shortness of breath, fever, chills along with elevated differential white cell counts, it is advisable to have bone marrow examination done to rule out hematological malignancy. I am not convinced with your RR of 98. Have you checked it correctly? Please update.

I passed through your question carefully and recommended performing further tests to investigate possible causes underlying your complaints.
1. Vitamin B12 and Vitamin D plasma levels for possible deficiency.

You should discuss with your doctor the above tests.

"Hello doctor,
I am a 30-year-old female. The initial illness began early this year. The symptoms were cough, shortness of breath SOB, chest pain, and wheezing. I was treated for pneumonia but never got better. Repeated X-rays showed adenopathy as a possibility. So, a CT scan was done which showed hilar, mediastinal adenopathy and a single pulmonary nodule of 0.47 inch along with some hypodense lesions on the spleen. A biopsy was done on the lung tissue and on the endobronchial mass but not on the lymph nodes or nodule. There was no fungal, bacterial or viral cause isolated. I have been largely asymptomatic since then with an exception of some chest pain. I went in for a follow-up computed tomography CT scan last week. There is still hilar, mediastinal adenopathy and now pre-tracheal aortopulmonary adenopathy along with the nodule. But, the size is the same. The doctor wants a CT scan in four months and thinks this could be the result of a fungal infection but he is not sure. I am wondering if a biopsy of the actual nodes or nodule would be necessary to rule out cancer. I am so concerned and the thought of waiting four months is devastating. I am a former smoker for five years. I take Lexapro, Adderall, and Microgestin.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com. I went through your history. There are two clinching things. One is apulmonary nodule and other is mediastinal adenopathy. 1. For pulmonary nodule of 1.2 cm, it can be due to a number of reasons. But, if it is not enlarging in size it is most probably benign. Just get a simple computed tomography CT guided FNAC fine needle aspiration cytology properly incorrectly taken sample gives false results. 2. If FNAC is not showing anything, then surely it is not a lung mass. Then, you can consider a fungal infection and rather than trying to diagnose it, take a course of antifungal not everything is ideal in medical science. 3. For hilar lymphadenopathy, you should to an EBUS endobronchial ultrasound and get an FNAC of the mediastinal adenopathy. It will surely tell us everything about cancer if any. 4. The probable diagnoses are sarcoidosis, fungal infection and a benign mass in the lung at the age of 30, there is very less chance of malignancy.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 7, 'transparency': 9}"

Masturbation does not cause a decrease in the size of the penis. It is incorrect to think that or believe that. Most of the young boys are obsessed with the size of the penis.

Welcome to iclinq.com.
Addisons disease primary adrenal insufficiency can be due to many causes. It is like when your adrenal glands are not producing the hormones they usually produce. While in the past, infections particularly tuberculosis were the most common cause for the destruction of adrenals, but now the most common cause worldwide is autoimmune destruction of the adrenals. As with other autoimmune diseases, there can be a hereditary component and associated with other autoimmune diseases.
Weight loss, fatigue, postural hypotension feeling dizzy when upright and hyperpigmentation are the initial symptoms. Among those, you have a few. You should definitely get yourself screened for it, by undertaking a Cosyntropin stimulation test. And if that is positive, you should get your plasma renin activity checked, along with serum aldosterone concentration. Also serum ACTH levels. Increased basal serum ACTH concentration, high renin, and low aldosterone will help in making the diagnosis.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern. Sildenafil is a rapid-acting drug with a shorter duration of action. Due to Sildenafil, some patients can develop hypotension with headaches. This can be a cause in your case. To prevent having this, try to drink plenty of water before taking this tablet. This helps to prevent having a fall in blood pressure.

"Hello doctor,
I went in for my anatomy scan at 18 weeks. The scan lasted about 30 minutes. All seemed to look great and the ultrasound tech seemed to be very positive. She commented some on the baby moving but never commented on it hard getting photos due to the movement. She took about 85 images total for the Radiologist to review.
We were able to see every part of the baby and even were amazed when it came to her heart that you could see all four chambers. We left very positive and excited. Two hours later I received a call from my doctors office stating the results came back and looked fine however there was suboptimal evaluation of fetal heart, spine, and kidneys. My doctor told me I would need to go back in for an ultrasound in two weeks. I am worried to death that there is something wrong. My doctor made it sound like no big deal but I have been an emotional mess since hearing the news. My questions are as follows...
1. Is this normal and happens frequently, especially with a scan at 18 weeks?
2. What does suboptimal evaluation mean? If the picture was blurry or not of good quality would they not say suboptimal visualization?
3. We have heard the babys heart many times and her heartbeat is consistently around 142 beats per minute. We even have a fetal monitor and have always heard a strong beat, no murmurs or concerns. What are the signs if something were wrong with her heart?
4. If the problem came down to poor imagery, why did not my doctor just say that? Could they be keeping a larger problem from me?
5. If the radiologist saw something of concern would they say, a problem with the heart needs to come back in for re-evaluation or suggest seeing a specialist?

I had a neck fusion a few years back. I like to understand more about my MRI. I am going to start Gabapentin for nerve issues soon and also I have Crohns disease and Lyme. Currently experiencing pins and needles in both legs. I have seen a neurologist and going to see a few surgeons this week. I would like to know, what you think about all this information? The neck is worse than the back at this point. Also, I want to know what my options are for fixing scar tissue? Thank you in advance.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have read through your query in detail. Sorry to hear the pain and discomfort you are having and wish you a quick recovery. Please find my observations below.
Your MRI scan reports attachment removed to protect patient identity show that there are changes seen in the neck region of the spinal cord at the level of fusion surgery for which the term myelomalacia softening of the spinal cord and myelopathy compression of the spinal cord has been used.
The cervical spondylosis has probably increased from before. These changes make the neck changes a little worse than the lower back. There is significant pinching of nerve roots at C6 - C7 level on the right side and this becomes important because it affects your daily activities. There are changes in the spinal cord at this level which is a concern.
If you are right-handed and have to use the computer at work then this can be one of the reasons for the tingling and numbness. The lower back problem is mild and is of less concern when compared to the neck.
In conclusion, the visit to the neurosurgeon should be focused on reducing the nerve pinching in the neck C6 - C7 level and preventing any progressive changes in the spinal cord at that level.
I would be glad if you can share the CD so that I can have a look at your images. However, my observations will most likely be the same as mentioned above.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 93, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}"
"Hi doctor,
From yesterday, I am suffering from loose motions and vomiting. I do not feel fever, but, whatever I eat, I feel it is in my throat. I feel vomiting sensation. I feel very weak, drowsy and not able to do my normal work. Also, felt left side shoulder and chest discomfort. My age is 31 and I do not have any bad habits. I have high triglycerides around 345 and other lipid levels are normal. For the past two years, my triglycerides are in this range only. I have taken Pantop 40 mg, some tablets for stopping motion and Nicip pain killer for left side chest and shoulder pain. I feel tightness also, but doctors confirmed it is not a heart problem,  Three days back, I ate sweets and since then I feel very discomfort. Four months back, I have undergone ECG, TMT and other tests which showed all normal. Kindly do the needful. Thank you.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com. We are here to help you with your current condition of acute gastroenteritis AGE. While most cases of diarrhea are viral and resolve within three to five days without antibiotics, the presence of blood in your stools suggests bacterial dysentery. To address this, I recommend antibiotics such as Ofloxacin and Ornidazole. It would also be beneficial for you to take probiotics containing Lactobacillus, as they can provide relief. Including yogurt in your diet is another natural probiotic option.
If you experience persistent vomiting, antiemetics like Domperidone and Ondansetron may be necessary. Additionally, it is important to drink plenty of oral rehydration salts ORS to combat dehydration. Remember to pass urine frequently, and if your urine appears yellowish, it could indicate ongoing dehydration or jaundice. Regarding your chest pain, it appears to be related to either anxiety or gastric issues. Taking a combination of Rabeprazole and Levosulpiride for a few days should help alleviate these symptoms. However, I advise against using Nicip tablets as they contain Nimesulide, which should be avoided. It is important to consult a specialist doctor, discuss your condition with them, and take medications with their consent.

"Hi doctor,
Recently, I had a Holter monitor, which showed 7000 ventricle ectopic beats and a few short runs of VT, only four beats or less than that. My doctor has referred me to a cardiologist. When I asked if it is dangerous, she said no and said that I could exercise. Is that true? I am extremely worried.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Ventricular ectopics are abnormal beats, which have their origin in the ventricle chamber of the heart. A few ventricular ectopics are a common finding, but 7000 ventricular ectopics cannot be neglected. VT ventricular tachycardia of less than 30 seconds is called non-sustained VT. Ventricular tachycardia and ectopics can never be neglected as VT can give rise to ventricular fibrillation, which can be life-threatening and is an emergency. I suggest you Metoprolol 25 mg twice daily. I do not agree with your doctors suggestion. Consult a specialist doctor, discuss with him or her. Are you a smoker or alcoholic? What is your anxiety level? Why was Holter done? Kindly send the photos of Holter. Do you feel palpitations? Are you sedentary? Do you have a family history of cardiac ailment? Do not neglect your findings as it can be dangerous. My advice is to get treadmill test and 2D echocardiogram.","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hi doctor,
I have a doubt. My blood pressure is usually 9060 mmHg. I went to my doctor, and he prescribed me Propranolol for sinus tachycardia which has happened to me over the last week. The tachycardia is not persistent and lasts for minutes, then resolves for example, in the mornings, or when I walk, my heart beats way faster 126 bpm. I fear that if I take Propranolol, my blood pressure will go lower, and I will suffer a shock. It seems dangerous to me to take a blood pressure-lowering agent while having low blood pressure. I need an opinion. Thank you.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
Considering your blood pressure and Holter report where there are pauses, beta-blockers like Propranolol should be used cautiously or avoided. Propranolol may lower blood pressure, so even if it has to be used, it should be in the lowest dose, like 10 milligrams, and with active blood pressure monitoring. But, considering there are also pauses in the Holter report that may be aggravated by Propranolol, it is better to avoid it. The likely cause for your syncope is also these pauses. So, you need to discuss pacemakers with your local doctor to care of the pauses. I hope this helps you, and get back if you have any doubts or more information to share.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
In your report attachment removed to protect patient identity, they have found inflammatory changes at the cervix and a low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia as well. For that, you need a colposcopy. Conservative treatment by ablation or excision of a transformational zone to send it to histopathology laboratory or close recurrent follow up without treatment. If colposcopy evaluation by endocervical biopsy and curettage is done completely and the doctor might recommend you excision, then further follow-ups by recurrent pap smear and maybe biopsies can be done, if needed.
It is better to have treatment now rather than wait further to have a more complex disease. It would be better if you could send me your description in detail with your previous medical, surgical, gynecological and obstetric history. Just word operation is not a complete description of your doctors advice.

"Hello doctor,
I do chew my cud. I mean after 5 minutes of eating, I vomit what I just ate severely until the food digests. But my main question is that what are the advantages and disadvantages of this? And also, can this make someone not to gain weight?","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
It is very interesting question. Normally only animals who consume food in a hurry and contain rumen bring back the food and then chew slowly properly and swallow the chewed cud. Humans chew slowly and there is no rumen and chewing cud is very unusual and extremely rare. There are people who chew cud who are otherwise healthy.
This chewing cud may not be the cause for your low weight. Chewing cud is not resulting in loss of nutrients. There are no advantages of chewing cud.  It is an unusual phenomenon in humans.

Your worry about infection is there for every one, if you are so worried you can  ask your partner to do a blood work up then have sex.

Thank you for stopping by
I am here to provide expert opinions on your medical issues.
I have reviewed your reports attachments removed to protect patient privacy and it appears that you have dyslipidemia an imbalance of lipids. Your low white cells and neutrophils are just a normal finding, do not worry about it. Your monocytes are a bit high but that could be because of a recent upper respiratory tract infection. Dyslipidemia, which is evident is of prime importance and it could be because of either Anorexia nervosa an eating disorder in which people stress about their weight and what they eat or any medications which you take long term. I suggest you do the following
1. Eat a healthy low-fat diet with more fruits and vegetables.
2. Avoid being empty stomach for long hours.
3. Exercise daily for 30 minutes.

You have not mentioned how long you have had this problem and how kidney concretion was detected. Which medication was given for kidney concretion? At your age, urine obstruction problems can have many causes. It is essential to diagnose the cause first to plan the correct treatment. One of the most common causes is ureteric stone, bladder infection, or a blockage in the urine tube stricture urethra. First, you must repeat your ultrasound at a good center and do a urine microscopy test. These tests will detect stone or urine infection problems if present. If both tests are normal, then a cystoscopy testan endoscopy to see inside the urethra will be needed to see for any stricture or other problems in the urethra. Once the problem is diagnosed, treatment can be planned.

"Hello doctor,
I began presenting last fall with some chronic fatigue. The initial blood work showed low iron saturation without anemia. I have attached reports of the same. There were other endocrine-related findings as well. In the course of various endocrine-related treatments and corresponding blood work, I began iron supplementation in the form of ferrous sulfate 143 mg daily. I began this before the blood work was done. So, you can see that that the levels have increased. Subsequent testing, a month later, showed a decline despite continuing treatment. Most recently, you can see that the levels are back up. Note that the ferritin levels began a bit low around 27 ngmL and had increased to 30 ngmL.
I have received a wide range of conflicting advice about whether low iron levels in the absence of anemia can cause fatigue. I have also received a range of conflicting advice about whether to continue iron supplementation. One doctor told me to continue taking the iron until the ferritin is up around 50 or so. Another said that would be unnecessary and to discontinue it and wait for three months to re-measure the blood work. It is all quite puzzling. Please help me to understand irons role, if any, in fatigue in the absence of anemia. And help me to then understand the rationale for treatment or lack thereof. And finally, please give me some sense of when iron toxicity emerges in terms of blood work measurements and at what frequency one needs to check the iron levels during any supplementation.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
In my opinion, iron supplementation can be stopped because serum iron, TIBC total iron binding capacity and hemoglobin levels are within the range.
Fatigue can occur in hypothyroidism, or due to anxiety, lack of sleep, exhaustion, stress or lack of exercise.
Repeat CBC complete blood count after few weeks and upload the results.
The following investigations, if done, will reveal the exact cause of your fatigue
Thyroid profile.
Serum potassium, Calcium and Sodium levels.
Liver and kidney profile.
Nerve conduction velocity.
Electromyography.
FSH and LH levels.

I consulted a nephrologist and he told me that protein loss is not usual at the age of 62 with diabetes. After that, he advised me to take tablet Cetanil 40 mg. Now, I feel extremely weak. Do I need to change the tablet or medicines for weakness?","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
As per your description, you have diabetes, hypertension, and other complications such as retinopathy and nephropathy. Your blood sugar level is good and other investigations look fair. Your doctor has prescribed you the right medicine. Cetanil-T Cilnidipine with Telmisartan and it is used to treat proteinuria. It does not cause weakness. The two reasons that cause weakness in you are low blood pressure or low blood sugar. Check your blood pressure in a lying-down position and after standing up for three minutes. If there is a fall of more than 20 mmHg in systolic blood pressure or more than 10 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure, then it is necessary to reduce your anti-hypertensive medications.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 92, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 9, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 80, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}"

"Hello doctor,
I am very worried because I have generalized anxiety with panic. I also have major health anxiety, and I am scared that I might have some kind of tumor in my head. I have not felt like myself due to nausea and heartburn, and I have seen a gastroenterologist who said it was acid reflux or GERD. I have headaches that come and go mainly on my right side over my eyebrow, neck discomfort, and shaky often when I am nervous, and I feel like my neck tremors a bit, but I needed someone to speak to or calm me down.

Welcome to icliniq.com.
I understand your concern.
Your symptoms are not suggestive of any brain tumor. In fact, anxiety can mimic all these symptoms, leading to a higher sensitivity of the nervous system, causing headaches, muscle twitching, or tremor.
For this reason, I would suggest you take the tablet Duloxetine, which can help you improve anxiety and your other symptoms like headache and tremor.
You should discuss with your physician on the above treatment option.
I also suggest you take a CT computed tomography scan or MRI magnetic resonance imaging of the brain to put your mind at peace.
Hope you will find this information helpful.

The baby is now hospitalized for emergency treatment. If the placenta is low-lying, it may bleed profusely if it has already bled twice, which is very concerning. If the membranes truely ruptured, there is a risks of infections, chorioamnionitis, stillbirth, extreamly difficult survival of developing baby because babys lung are to weak to take breath and survive even with neonatal support. If the placenta still coverning the external os and membrane has ruptured, she requires emergency surgery to avoid life-threatening bleeding.

You can see the buckle actually by asking him to look at all different peripheral gazes. The buckle will be seen as an elevated part in the otherwise normal conjunctiva. As for breaks you have to look for flashes of light if seen by him or any floaters. The blood you are seeing is subconjunctival hemorrhage.

"Hi doctor,
I was diagnosed seven years ago with Hashimotos thyroiditis. I gave up gluten, soy, and milk, and along with Levothyroxine, my health has been great. However, two years ago, I was diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency. After six months of treatment, I recovered. Then after having a second baby last year, I started having strange symptoms.
My symptoms included
1. Numb spots on my legs.
2. Electric shock sensations between my legs.
3. Cramps in my calves and ankles.
4. Tiredness
I was very tired, but I was also up all night with a new baby. So, I do not know if that is a symptom or not. Then early this year, I went for my yearly physical. It showed that my TSH was high. Apparently, after my son was born, they put my medication too low normally, I take 100 mcg, but they put me down to 75 mcg a day. I took this amount for four months. I then started taking 100 mcg a day again.
A few weeks later, I developed chronic pain all over. This included cramps, burning, stinging sensations, and electric shocks. The first doctor thought it was just hormonal and said it would go away. After about three months, I finally saw an endocrinologist. He did a thyroid panel, and everything was normal. So, he referred me to an internal medicine doctor. The internal medicine doctor thought it might be an active b12 deficiency. They do not have the active b12 test where I live. So my doctor decided to treat me as if I had a b12 deficiency. So after taking some oral supplements, I was started on weekly injections for four weeks. My startup symptoms were rough basically, I felt much worse - more electric shock sensations, joints popping, etc. Then I began to feel better. Then after my fourth injection, I was pain-free and feeling great.
However, this only lasted about four or five weeks. Then the pain came back. My doctor then recommended one shot every day for six days, then weekly shots for six weeks. The week I was having a shot every day, I began to feel better again though not quite pain-free. Once that was finished, and I started with weekly shots, it was more up and down. I began to notice a pattern. After each shot Friday, I would feel a little worse, but then by Wednesday, I would feel better but not pain-free. After six weeks, I was pain-free but only for about five days. Then the pain came back, and now I feel worse. I was negative for intrinsic factor although I have read false negatives happen 50  of the time. And as I stated before, all my serum levels are normal. But I responded to the b12 therapy really well initially. Can you help me? I feel like my doctor is close to giving up on me.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I just read your query, and from what you have mentioned, it appears that you have hypothyroidism and you are on treatment with Levothyroxine. It is known that hypothyroidism causes vitamin B12 deficiency over time, and if you are on a high dose of Levothyroxine, then you have a high chance of having decreased calcium levels as well, which is compensated by your bone demineralization process. So, you have basically another deficiency which is calcium as well.
I suggest you take the tablet Neurobion forte Vitamin B complex twice a day for your B12 deficiency and the tablet Calcium 500 mg once daily, spacing it four to six hours from Levothyroxine. Also, restart your Vitamin D 5000 IU daily. Mind you, these are recommended daily allowances RDA for a person. So, if you wish for a test, you can go ahead, but the treatment plan will still remain the same.","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 9}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 83, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,
I am a 55-year-old female. Before asking my question, I need to provide some background and context. I have had many surgeries and am a well-educated person. I am not a typical patient, given my knowledge, background, etc., including the fact that I get a copy of my complete chart for each surgery or medical procedure using any form of sedation or anesthesia. I am knowledgeable about most drugs used during anesthesia and how they work. I have been told by a surgeon included in his surgical report and two dentists that I require a lot of anesthesia. I have had multiple bad experiences with anesthesia, primarily conscious sedation. In my last surgery, I became alert, aware and had full memory of the second, third and fourth stitch. I have experienced pain and awareness or memory during other oral surgeries and other procedures. I abhor the idea of conscious sedation, and the drug versed, specifically, except when used for induction. I have had my specific verbal and written expectations violated. This has all lead to both fear of some simple procedures like oral surgery and even regular dentistry and a distrust that I will be cared for in a manner that I do not find acceptable. Two days ago, I had oral surgery and had some memory of pain and other things and, because of my experience, I am also a person that brings a high-quality recorder into the procedure room or OR when the opportunity presents itself. So, for the oral surgery two days ago, I recall experiencing pain and asking for more medication. I recall being told to calm down the audio recording supports these recollections, plus the oral surgeon and anesthesiologist, who I paid extra out-of-pocket to have available so I could be in deep sedation and not experience pain.
My question is short. I have a procedure with the anesthesiologist at 8 AM. He also does some pain management procedures, and I will be getting the nerve block test for lumbar RFA tomorrow. I will have a CRNA who will be doing the anesthesia or sedation. But, I wont be able to discuss what happened to me during oral surgery with the anesthesiologist. I am a bit upset about that. I have a fear of dental and other painful procedures. I know that the local anesthetics do not work as well on me as they do on others which is presumably why I was feeling pain and this is an issue not just for the procure in the morning. It is an ongoing issue that just grows more intense with every procedure that my trust is violated, and I experience pain and, I need the RFA. I have multiple herniated discs and arthritis, facet joint damage. I do not know how to articulate my needs in such a way that the anesthesiologist or CRNA later this morning or in the future takes my concerns seriously. I do not just need something to calm me, and in fact, the very thing that an anesthesiologist would use to calm me is one of the most fearful things to me. I do not want to experience pain. I do not need anesthesia, and I do not need to be calm well, I would be calm if these things did not repeatedly happen to me. I just need no pain and if that takes a heavier dose of Propofol in a hospital setting. So be it. If that takes more local anesthetic. So be it. I need to be unconscious, or I need enough pain management and deep sedation or no sedation. What do I need to say to get that without offending or getting interpreted as just another person who is afraid of the OR which I am not. Is it possible that I would share that after being given versed? What if I just tell them no versed? Low dose Propofol would do the same thing, right?
Please help me.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I have read your past experiences of conscious sedation, and I understand how difficult it would have been for you. One thing I want to clear you first is that conscious sedation does not mean general anesthesia. Conscious sedation works on this principle only that you or the patient is conscious. It may decrease the pain and increase the cooperation for the procedure, but it does not mean that you will not hear or feel anything. For small oral surgeries and small procedures, everywhere conscious sedation is used. It just means that it will decrease to some extent your feeling of pain and you might be sedated for most of the procedure time but not the whole time of the procedure. It means one can recall so many things from surgery in conscious sedation. If you want to be completely knocked down and not feel or listen anything then what you need is general anesthesia which is usually not given for small procedures.
Now coming to your problem. First, you need to discuss with your anesthesiologist better a day or few days before the surgery explaining him everything what happened in past surgeries and what you expect from him. If you will discuss this with your anesthetist a few days earlier or at least a day before, he will not think that you are just afraid of OR operating room. You have to make your mind and explain it to him that whether you want conscious sedation or general anesthesia. If you do not want to feel anything and not want to be awake in between the procedure, explain to him that you want general anesthesia and no sedation. Explain it to him clearly what are your experiences from past and what you expect from him this time in procedure.
Do you never talk to your colleague whenever you were doing your thesis or research work? I guess everybody does. It is routine work for them, so it is not possible that everybody is keeping silence during work. Have you never met a little difficult person to handle? Just answer one question, if you get a scary dream, is it good to have any horror dream repeated in your mind again and again or is it better to forget one. The choice is yours.
Telling some patient to calm down during a procedure is a type of psychotherapy, and it has been proven effective. It is not that the person wants to give you less drug, the problem with conscious sedation is that you have to limit the dosage of the drug or else the patient will stop breathing, and that is not what you or the doctor wants. So, better ask for general anesthesia. Last but not the least, consult a psychotherapist or psychiatrist regarding your past awareness of anesthesia. The sessions will help you remove or at least decrease the mental trauma from past episodes.

Do you have any symptoms like chest pain, heaviness, or breathlessness on exertion? Do you have any previous ECG electrocardiogram for comparison?

This means there are minor changes in the ECG. These can sometimes be normally seen in females. However, considering the age, diabetes, and cholesterol issues, the risk for heart diseases is high. So, I suggest you undergo further cardiac evaluation. You should do an echocardiogram as the first step and if it is normal, then go for a TMT treadmill test. I hope this helps you and get back if you have any more doubts. Also, attach the previous ECG if you have one.

"Hello doctor,
My mother is 97 years old. She had a minor heart failure with a B-type natriuretic peptide BNP of 110. Recently, she had a bad urinary tract infection UTI and asthma. Up to that point, her oxygen O2 saturation levels without supplemental oxygen were 95 to 96. Now that she is recovering from UTI, her O2 levels are 97 to 98 with 0.53 gallons of supplemental O2 and her O2 level without supplemental O2 are between 88 and 92. All of these numbers are at rest. She does not do too much activity. What can be the contributing factor to this change? She had a chest CT scan and it did not show chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD. Should she stay on the O2? It is somewhat of a hazard. The tubing is difficult for her to handle. We must have someone with her all the time even throughout the night. We are concerned if she gets up to use the bathroom her foot will get caught on the tubing. She had a complete blood workup done. All the results were normal except that she is anemic. Currently, she is using nebulizer given by the primary care physician containing Ipratropium, Levalbuterol, Budesonide and antibiotics for recurrent UTI.","Hi,
Welcome to icliniq.com. I do not understand the correlation between urinary tract infection UTI and low oxygen saturation. If the UTI has caused sepsis and multiorgan failure, then only it can affect lungs and saturation would drop. Asthma is a chronic disease and does not occur suddenly. She either had pre-existing asthma that got exacerbated by UTI or she had acute bronchitis or lower respiratory tract infection. I would recommend you go for a re-evaluation of her heart by 2D echocardiogram for her ejection fraction and for any signs of pulmonary embolism. If we do not treat the basic cause of falling saturation, we will not be able to come out of this problem. I would like to know whether you are treating her at home or hospital. Also, mention if you have her latest blood counts and urine test reports.","{'score': 92, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 7, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 93, 'clinical_accuracy': 18, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,
My daughter was 6.3 years old when I noticed that she has breast buds. After consulting the pediatric endocrinologist, we went for bone age and pelvic ultrasound tests. Both the tests were age appropriate. She is 4.03 feet tall, and I am 5.6 feet, and my husband is 5.10 feet tall. As she has bilateral breast buds, the doctor wanted to go for monthly Lupron injections, which I denied due to all the side effects. I heard it causes weight gain, depression, and decreases the bone density. Now I am highly confused. Should I go for the treatment? It has been four months, and I have not seen any difference in her breast or any growth acceleration. If yes, then is it worth the risk? Please suggest.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I just read your query about your daughter, and it appears that your daughter has precocious puberty and therefore it is necessary to give Lupron Leuprolide acetate injections. The problem is, if she continues without treatment, then she will reach a bone maturity sooner and will be possibly shorter than her predicted height. Normal adult height can be achieved in most cases if treatment is started before bone maturation is too advanced. Normally, bone maturation occurs after 12 years for girls and 13 years for boys. If good gonadal suppression is maintained for several years, this treatment allows growth to continue while dramatically slowing the rate of bone maturation.

I am using multiple things like Ayurvedic laxatives and Dulcoflex to pass the motion as I cannot operate if I do not clear. Please let me know if there is a solution to this.
Thank you.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I read your query and understand your concern.
For chronic constipation, intermittent switching of laxatives will help because long-term use of a single type of laxative will cause it to lose its efficacy. I suggest you add Psyllium Husk regularly to your diet and also take one to two Polyethylene glycol sachets per day.
Consult with your doctor, talk to them, and then take the medications.
Thank you.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,
I have had a stye in my eyes for the past few days. However, it did not resolve by using warm water. Can you suggest me a treatment for that? Please help.","Hello,
Welcome to icliniq.com.
I went through your query and understood your concern. I suggest you follow some instructions. Do warm compresses instead of warm water. Take a clean cloth, dip it in bearable water and keep it on your closed eyelid for about ten minutes, thrice a day. Take over-the-counter medications such as Moxifloxacin antibiotic 0.5  eyedrops or Tobramycin aminoglycoside antibiotic 0.3  eyedrops. Take a tablet of Paracetamol painkiller 650 milligrams three times a day. I also suggest you to avoid rubbing your eye because this causes minute dirt particles in your fingers to get into your eyes and cause stye and other infections. Always keep your hands clean. Kindly consult a specialist, talk with them, and take medicines with their consent. I hope this has helped you. Thanks and regards.","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}"
"Hello doctor,I am a 43-year-old male. Born with meningomyelocele and operated before I was 1. Operated for the clubbed foot at one and half years in. I can walk with elbow crutches. 17 years before bladder augmentation operation with appendicular vesicostomy surgery was done for urinary incontinence. But during the surgery, only bladder augmentation surgery was done and left with a suprapubic catheter, and appendicular vesicostomy was not done. Due to lumbar puncture for giving spinal analgesia, I lost sensation below the knee in both my legs.Due to the continuous loss of sensation after the operation, I developed severe wound and was treated with intravenous antibiotics. My right leg was amputated below the knee before six years. After the surgery, my left leg was affected by lymphangitis. Three years before due to long term retention of the suprapubic catheter, a two huge bladder stone of 5 cm and a small 3 cm was operated. Due to loss of spinal puncture, I am suffering from parenthesis till date. The photos of my leg are attached here along with the lymphoscintigraphy test report which shows a block in lymphatic vessels. Please let me know what treatment can be given to cure my problem and which doctor I should consult for my surgery.","Hello,

Your foot looks in bad state attachment removed to protect patient identity chronic lymphedema with skin changes. As this is a persistent problem, so there is no single treatment. There are lots of options to improve your leg condition, manual lymphatic drainage, complex decongestive therapy, surgery, limb elevation, and pressure garments. This you have to maintain lifelong. All the procedure has its pros and cons with varying degrees of success, and it may not match your expectation. You need to visit plastic surgeons and discussed with its detail.","{'score': 100, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 10, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 98, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 8, 'transparency': 10}","{'score': 90, 'clinical_accuracy': 20, 'use_of_retrieved_evidence': 0, 'transparency': 10}"
