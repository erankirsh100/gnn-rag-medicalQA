        "#### 1. DIAGNOSIS HYPOTHESIS\n",
        "- Clearly identify the most likely primary diagnosis or diagnoses based on the provided symptoms, history, risk factors and our pipeline data (RAG context, and graph-based knowledge). highlight key symptom patterns, onset, duration, and associated findings that support the hypothesis.\n",
        "- You may suggest more than one but **not to much to avoid confusion**. Do not present a list - instead, **write it as a flowing paragraph**.\n",
        "- Where applicable, integrate epidemiological clues (age, sex, comorbidities, geographical location, seasonality), and explicitly state how they change the likelihood of a diagnosis (‘This condition is more common in adolescents…’, ‘This presentation is less typical in females…’).\n",
        "- Consider the temporal relationship of symptoms (e.g., acute vs. chronic onset, progression pattern) as part of the diagnostic reasoning.\n",
        "- When the presentation is nonspecific, explain which additional details or tests would most help narrow the possibilities.\n",
        "- Summarize the hypothesis with a clear prioritization: primary likely cause, followed by alternative but less probable causes.\n",
        "- If there is not enough evidence for a confident diagnosis, clearly state that and provide reasonable hypotheses.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. CLINICAL REASONING\n",
        "\n",
        "- Explain your reasoning clearly and logically, describing how the symptoms contribute to the diagnostic hypotheses.\n",
        "- Support your conclusions by referencing specific information from the retrieved medical contexts, citing article titles or study names when relevant and available.\n",
        "- You may also refer to relevant supporting evidence more generally as “medical sources,” “clinical guidelines,” “published studies,” “medical literature”, etc.\n",
        "- For example:\n",
        "  - “Medical literature generally recognizes that symptoms A, B, and C often appear together in cases of X.”\n",
        "  - “A study titled ‘[Article Title]’ (Author et al., YEAR) found that symptom A commonly presents with symptom B, which supports the possibility of X in this case.”\n",
        "  - “Clinical guidelines from [Organization Name] (YEAR) recommend considering test Y when symptoms A and B are present.”\n",
        "  - “It is well established in clinical practice that symptom A can be an early indicator of condition Y.”\n",
        "  - “The recommended treatment for symptoms A, B, and C is X [direct suporting quotation] ([Author et al.] (YEAR), ‘[Article Title]’)”  (direct quotes are welcome!)\n",
        "\n",
        "  When available, always include at least one reference to a medical guideline, study, or reputable source that supports your reasoning, integrating it naturally in the text.\n",
        "- Incorporate structured clinical knowledge naturally by referring to well-known symptom clusters, disease co-occurrences, or common clinical patterns. For example, say:\n",
        "  - “It is well documented that symptoms A, B, and C frequently occur together in cases of X.”\n",
        "  - “Clinical experience and published cases commonly show that Y is associated with Z.”\n",
        "- Do **NOT** mention or refer to the AI system’s technical components or generation pipeline, such as “retrieved contexts,” “GNN,” “RAG,” “structured medical knowledge,” “knowledge graph,” or any internal data processing.\n",
        "- If the evidence is insufficient or ambiguous, state this transparently, for example:\n",
        "  - “The available information does not conclusively support a single diagnosis.”\n",
        "  - “Symptoms may suggest several possible causes, requiring further evaluation.”\n",
        "- Avoid over-explaining the origin of the knowledge; present the reasoning as if you were summarizing established medical evidence and clinical experience.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. SUGGESTED PLAN OF ACTION\n",
        "Provide an appropriate next step, based on the confidence level, potential severity, and clinical context.\n",
        "- Try answering the question 'what should i do next'\n",
        "Include some or all of the following when relevant:\n",
        "- Suggested **tests** (e.g., “consider complete blood count (CBC)”, “neurological exam recommended”)\n",
        "- Whether to **monitor symptoms**, or seek **immediate medical attention**\n",

        "  Safe, evidence-supported self-care measures and at-home care tips the user can begin at home right now. Provide a “what to do right now” guidance- immediately actionable things the user can do while waiting for the appointment e.g., hydration, rest, dietary adjustments, over-the-counter remedies when appropriate.\n",
        "- When applicable, encourage **consulting a specialist** (e.g., neurologist, pulmonologist) and expand on his next steps. Give a short “Here’s what will likely happen when you see X” (exams, possible tests).\n",
        "- If symptoms are potentially **serious or progressive**, encourage seeking **prompt medical evaluation** (e.g., physician consultation)\n",
        "\n",

        "- Cautious but confident in logical reasoning — do not speculate wildly, but explain what is likely based on the input.\n",
        "- Empathetic, respectful, and aware that the user may be anxious or confused. Avoid cold or overly technical language unless it is clearly explained.\n",
        "- Informative, but not overwhelming — prioritize clarity and helpfulness over medical verbosity.\n",
        "- Responsible — never provide false reassurance or definitive answers when the situation is uncertain or potentially serious.\n",
        "- Balanced and calm — do not use language that is alarming or anxiety-provoking (e.g., “this could be deadly”) unless medically necessary. Instead, say things like “this may indicate a condition that requires urgent evaluation.”\n",
        "- Supportive, not dismissive — even if the symptoms appear mild, avoid brushing them off. Acknowledge them and offer realistic, medically informed next steps.\n",
        "- Reassuring when appropriate — if symptoms are truly minor and all inputs point to low-risk explanations, it is okay to gently reassure the user — but always suggest professional confirmation.\n",

Explain which symptoms contribute to which diagnosis, how medical sources or clinical guidelines support these conclusions, and any uncertainties involved. Use phrases like “Medical literature indicates…”, “Clinical evidence supports…”, or “These symptoms are consistent with…” Avoid mentioning the AI system’s retrieval methods or graph knowledge explicitly.\n",

Based on the symptoms you've described, including persistent fatigue, mild shortness of breath, and occasional palpitations, one possible explanation is iron deficiency anemia.

        "Persistent fatigue and palpitations are commonly seen in individuals with reduced red blood cell counts or low hemoglobin levels. Shortness of breath with exertion further supports a hematologic cause rather than a primarily respiratory one. Thyroid disorders can produce similar symptoms and remain a consideration. There are no clear indications of infection, significant cardiac disease, or acute respiratory illness at this stage.\n",

        "It would be advisable to schedule a primary care appointment for a complete blood workup, including a complete blood count (CBC) and iron studies.

            "**General Symptoms (can occur in both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes):**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Increased Thirst (Polydipsia):** You may feel unusually thirsty, even after drinking fluids. This is because high blood sugar draws fluid from your tissues.\n",
            "*   **Frequent Urination (Polyuria):** You'll likely need to urinate more often, especially at night. Your kidneys are working overtime to filter out the excess sugar from your blood, and this excess sugar is then excreted in your urine, taking water with it.\n",
            "*   **Increased Hunger (Polyphagia):** Despite eating, you may feel constantly hungry. This is because your cells aren't getting enough glucose for energy, even though there's plenty in your bloodstream.\n",
            "*   **Unexplained Weight Loss:** This is more common in Type 1 diabetes, but can also occur in Type 2. Your body starts breaking down muscle and fat for energy because it can't use glucose effectively.\n",
            "*   **Fatigue and Weakness:** Feeling tired and lacking energy is a very common symptom. This is due to your cells not receiving the glucose they need for fuel.\n",
            "*   **Blurred Vision:** High blood sugar levels can cause the lenses in your eyes to swell, affecting your ability to focus. This can lead to temporary blurred vision.\n",
            "*   **Slow-Healing Sores or Cuts:** High blood sugar can impair your body's ability to heal.\n",
            "*   **Frequent Infections:** People with diabetes may be more prone to infections, such as skin infections, urinary tract infections, and yeast infections.\n",
            "*   **Numbness or Tingling in the Hands or Feet (Neuropathy):** Over time, high blood sugar can damage nerves, leading to a pins-and-needles sensation or numbness, particularly in the extremities.\n",
            "*   **Dry, Itchy Skin:** Poor circulation and dehydration can contribute to dry, itchy skin.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Specific Symptoms to Note:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Type 1 Diabetes:** Symptoms often develop rapidly, sometimes over a few weeks or months. They can be quite severe.\n",
            "*   **Type 2 Diabetes:** Symptoms often develop gradually and may be so mild that they go unnoticed for years. Many people with Type 2 diabetes are diagnosed during routine medical checkups. Some people with Type 2 diabetes may not experience any noticeable symptoms at all.\n",
            "*   **Gestational Diabetes:** This type of diabetes develops during pregnancy and often has no noticeable symptoms. It's usually detected through routine screening tests during pregnancy.\n",

An evaluation by an otolaryngologist (ENT) is recommended for nasal endoscopy to confirm diagnosis and assess severity.

Surgical removal may be considered if medical therapy fails to improve symptoms.\",\n",

Endocrine causes such as hypothyroidism or adrenal insufficiency remain differential considerations. Comprehensive evaluation should include orthostatic vitals, thyroid function testing, cortisol levels, and screening for anemia. A multidisciplinary management approach is often required.\",\n",

Allergic airway inflammation is also a possible trigger, particularly if symptoms worsen with exposure to dust, pollen, or cold air. Pulmonary function testing, including spirometry with bronchodilator response, is recommended to clarify diagnosis.

Based on the symptoms you've described \\u2013 persistent sadness, loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities, difficulty getting out of bed, poor concentration, and constant fatigue, all occurring for several months \\u2013 this constellation of symptoms is highly suggestive of a depressive disorder. Specifically, the combination of low mood and anhedonia (loss of interest or pleasure) lasting for this duration strongly points towards **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)**. The symptom of fatigue and impaired concentration are also common features that align with this diagnosis.\\n\\nThe medical literature, as reflected in sources such as \\\"Major Depressive Disorder: Diagnostic Criteria and Treatment Approaches,\\\" highlights that MDD is characterized by a persistent low mood, anhedonia, and impaired functioning, which aligns precisely with your sister's presentation. Clinical information also indicates that this condition is more common in females, and your sister's age (38) falls within a typical demographic for the onset of such mood disturbances. The duration of \\\"months\\\" is also a key factor in meeting diagnostic criteria for persistent depressive conditions, differentiating it from transient low moods. While your sister has no prior mental health treatment history, this does not preclude a first-episode depressive illness.\\n\\nThe persistent fatigue and struggles with daily functioning, like getting out of bed, are also key indicators. Medical sources consistently report fatigue as a core symptom in Major Depressive Disorder. Furthermore, poor concentration can significantly impact daily life and work, and is a well-documented symptom in depressive states. The lack of interest in things she used to enjoy is known as anhedonia, a cardinal symptom of depression. While these symptoms could potentially overlap with other conditions, their persistence and the combination presented are most characteristic of a depressive episode.\\n\\nGiven these symptoms and their duration, it would be highly beneficial for your sister to consult with a healthcare professional, such as her primary care physician or a mental health specialist. They can conduct a thorough evaluation to confirm a diagnosis and discuss appropriate treatment options. Medical sources like \\\"Innovations in Depression Management: Psychotherapy and Pharmacotherapy\\\" suggest that evidence-based treatments, including psychotherapy (such as cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy) and potentially pharmacotherapy, can be very effective. Early recognition and intervention, as noted in \\\"Major Depressive Disorder: Diagnostic Criteria and Treatment Approaches,\\\" are crucial for improving long-term outcomes. While waiting for her appointment, encouraging open communication, ensuring she has a supportive environment, and gently encouraging small, manageable activities could be helpful, but professional guidance will be key.\\n\\n\\u26a0\\ufe0f Note, this is an AI-generated, evidence-guided clinical suggestion. It is **not a professional medical diagnosis** and should **never replace consultation with a licensed healthcare provider and medical care**. My goal is to support you with relevant information and guidance, but only a medical professional can provide a full evaluation.\",\n          \"Hello, thank you for reaching out and sharing these concerning symptoms with me. It sounds like you are experiencing significant fatigue and a feeling of lightheadedness or impending faintness upon standing, which can be very disruptive to daily life.\\n\\nBased on your description, particularly the profound, persistent fatigue that is not relieved by adequate sleep, and the sensation of feeling like you might faint when standing up, a primary diagnostic consideration is orthostatic intolerance. This is a condition where your body has trouble regulating blood pressure and heart rate when transitioning from lying down to standing. This aligns with symptoms described in medical literature, such as in a review concerning fatigue and autonomic dysfunction, which suggests that dysregulated autonomic responses can contribute to such feelings of intolerance. Furthermore, your symptoms are highly suggestive of conditions that fall under the umbrella of orthostatic intolerance, and specifically, the persistent fatigue could point towards Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), which medical sources indicate often coexists with orthostatic intolerance. Another condition to consider within this spectrum, supported by the concept of autonomic regulation issues, is Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), known for causing dizziness and fatigue upon standing. While less specific to the exact symptoms described, thyroid disorders are also known to cause significant fatigue and are recognized in clinical knowledge as a potential contributor to widespread systemic symptoms.\\n\\nThe combination of severe fatigue and symptoms like lightheadedness when standing up is a recognized pattern that warrants a thorough medical evaluation. The feeling of near-fainting on standing, often referred to as presyncope, is a key indicator of orthostatic intolerance. Medical literature, such as the journal article 'Orthostatic Intolerance and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Clinical Correlations', highlights a significant correlation between the severity of fatigue and the degree of orthostatic intolerance, suggesting these conditions frequently occur together and should be considered in conjunction. The persistent nature of your fatigue, lasting for weeks despite adequate sleep, also suggests it is not merely a temporary consequence of stress. The structured clinical knowledge also points to connections between fatigue, orthostatic hypotension (a specific type of orthostatic intolerance), and conditions like CFS.\\n\\nGiven the potential severity and impact on your daily functioning, it is important to seek professional medical advice. A physician would likely begin with a detailed medical history and physical examination. Recommended initial investigations may include blood tests to assess for anemia, thyroid function, and electrolyte imbalances, as well as an electrocardiogram (ECG) to evaluate heart rhythm. If orthostatic intolerance is suspected, specific tests like a tilt table test or autonomic function tests might be considered to formally assess how your body regulates blood pressure and heart rate upon changing posture. Your physician can then provide tailored advice and treatment plans, which may involve lifestyle adjustments, specific medications, or referral to a specialist like a cardiologist or neurologist depending on the findings. In the meantime, focusing on maintaining good hydration and avoiding sudden changes in position may offer some comfort, but this is not a substitute for a medical evaluation.\\n\\n\\u26a0\\ufe0f Note, this is an AI-generated, evidence-guided clinical suggestion. It is **not a professional medical diagnosis** and should **never replace consultation with a licensed healthcare provider and medical care**. My goal is to support you with relevant information and guidance, but only a medical professional can provide a full evaluation.\",\n          \"Hello, thank you for sharing these concerning symptoms with me. Based on your description of worsening joint pain in your hands and wrists, particularly in the mornings with prolonged stiffness, and occasional knee aching, one strong possibility to consider is rheumatoid arthritis.\\n\\nYour symptoms, especially the symmetrical joint involvement (hands and wrists) and the pronounced morning stiffness lasting for hours, align very well with the typical presentation of rheumatoid arthritis. Medical literature, including sources such as \\\"Rheumatoid Arthritis: Pathogenesis and Clinical Features\\\" by Harris and Budd (2020), highlights that chronic symmetric polyarthritis and prolonged morning stiffness are characteristic features of this autoimmune disorder. The fact that you are experiencing this in your hands and wrists is particularly relevant, as these are common sites for initial involvement. While your age and gender are not strongly suggestive of increased risk factors based on the provided contexts, the duration and pattern of your symptoms are highly indicative. The provided structured knowledge also directly links \\\"rheumatoid arthritis\\\" with \\\"morning stiffness\\\" and \\\"joint pain,\\\" reinforcing this hypothesis.\\n\\nGiven these symptoms, it is important to consider rheumatoid arthritis as a primary diagnostic hypothesis. Medical sources indicate that if left untreated, rheumatoid arthritis can lead to progressive joint damage, as noted in the \\\"Rheumatoid Arthritis: Pathogenesis and Clinical Features\\\" review. Therefore, early diagnosis and intervention are crucial for managing the condition and improving long-term outcomes.\\n\\nTo clarify the situation and confirm a diagnosis, the most responsible next step would be to schedule an appointment with your primary care physician. They can conduct a thorough physical examination, discuss your medical history in more detail, and order further investigations. These investigations commonly include blood tests to look for markers of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), as well as autoantibodies like rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies, which are frequently elevated in rheumatoid arthritis. Depending on the initial findings, your physician may also refer you to a rheumatologist, a specialist in joint and connective tissue diseases, for expert management.\\n\\nIn the meantime, while awaiting your appointment, you may find some relief from gentle stretching of your hands and wrists after waking. Avoiding activities that exacerbate your pain, if possible, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle can also be beneficial. However, it is crucial to understand that these measures are supportive and do not replace professional medical evaluation.\\n\\n\\u26a0\\ufe0f Note, this is an AI-generated, evidence-guided clinical suggestion.

The symptoms you've described \\u2013 persistent sadness, loss of interest, difficulty getting out of bed, poor concentration, and fatigue \\u2013 are all significant indicators that she may be experiencing depression.\\n\\nGiven that she's been feeling this way for months and it's impacting her daily life, it's important that she receives professional support. Since she hasn't had mental health treatment before, this can feel like a big step, but it's a crucial one.\\n\\nHere's a breakdown of what you can do and what might be helpful for her:\\n\\n**1. Encourage Her to Seek Professional Help:**\\n\\nThis is the most important step. Depression is a treatable medical condition, and a healthcare professional can provide an accurate diagnosis and develop an appropriate treatment plan.\\n\\n*   **Suggest a Doctor's Visit:** The first point of contact could be her primary care physician (GP). They can rule out any underlying physical health conditions that might be contributing to her symptoms (like thyroid issues or vitamin deficiencies) and can also make referrals to mental health specialists.\\n*   **Mental Health Professionals:**\\n    *   **Therapists/Counselors:** These professionals can provide talk therapy (psychotherapy), which is highly effective for depression. Common types include Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Interpersonal Therapy (IPT).\\n    *   **Psychiatrists:** These are medical doctors who specialize in mental health. They can diagnose mental health conditions, prescribe medication if needed, and also offer therapy.\\n*   **How to Approach the Conversation:**\\n    *   **Be Gentle and Supportive:** Avoid accusatory language. Instead, express your concern from a place of love. Phrases like, \\\"I've noticed you haven't been yourself lately, and I'm worried about you,\\\" or \\\"I care about you, and I think talking to someone might help you feel better,\\\" can be effective.\\n    *   **Validate Her Feelings:** Let her know that what she's experiencing is real and that it's okay to feel this way.\\n    *   **Offer Practical Support:** She might be too fatigued or overwhelmed to make appointments or research options. Offer to help her find a therapist, make the call, or even go with her to her first appointment if she'd like.\\n    *   **Emphasize Treatability:** Reassure her that depression is treatable and that many people find significant relief with professional help.\\n\\n**2. What to Expect from Professional Help:**\\n\\n*   **Diagnosis:** A professional will conduct an assessment to understand her symptoms, their duration, and their impact on her life.\\n*   **Treatment Options:**\\n    *   **Therapy (Psychotherapy):** This is often the first line of treatment. It helps individuals understand their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and develop coping mechanisms.\\n    *   **Medication:** Antidepressant medications can be very effective in managing the chemical imbalances in the brain associated with depression. A psychiatrist or doctor can determine if medication is appropriate and which type would be best.\\n    *   **Lifestyle Changes:** Therapy and medication are often combined with recommendations for lifestyle adjustments.\\n\\n**3. How You Can Support Her (While Respecting Her Autonomy):**\\n\\n*   **Be a Good Listener:** Let her talk without judgment. Sometimes, just having someone to listen can be incredibly helpful.\\n*   **Encourage Small Steps:** Don't push her to do too much too soon. Celebrate small victories, like getting out of bed, taking a shower, or going for a short walk.\\n*   **Offer Practical Help:** Help with chores, errands, or meal preparation if she's struggling.\\n*   **Encourage Healthy Habits (Gently):**\\n    *   **Sleep:** Encourage a regular sleep schedule, even if it's difficult.\\n    *   **Nutrition:** Offer to cook healthy meals or go grocery shopping together.\\n    *   **Exercise:** Suggest short walks or gentle activities. Even a few minutes of movement can make a difference.\\n    *   **Social Connection:** Encourage her to spend time with supportive friends and family, even if it's just for a short period.\\n*   **Educate Yourself:** Learning about depression can help you understand what she's going through and how to best support her.\\n*   **Take Care of Yourself:** Supporting someone with depression can be emotionally draining. Make sure you have your own support system and practice self-care.\\n\\n**4. What to Avoid:**\\n\\n*   **Minimizing her feelings:** Phrases like \\\"just snap out of it\\\" or \\\"you have so much to be grateful for\\\" can be invalidating and unhelpful.\\n*   **Blaming her:** Depression is not a choice or a sign of weakness.\\n*   **Giving unsolicited advice:** Unless you are a mental health professional, focus on listening and supporting rather than trying to \\\"fix\\\" her.\\n*   **Taking it personally:** Her withdrawal or irritability may be symptoms of her illness, not a reflection of her feelings towards you.\\n\\n**If you are concerned about her immediate safety (e.g., if she expresses thoughts of harming herself), please do not hesitate to seek immediate professional help:**\\n\\n*   **Call a crisis hotline:** In the US, you can call or text 988.\\n*   **Go to the nearest emergency room.**\\n*   **Contact her doctor immediately.**\\n\\nIt's a journey, and recovery takes time. Your consistent support and encouragement for her to seek professional help will be invaluable.\",\n          \"It's completely understandable that you're concerned, especially when you're feeling this exhausted and experiencing symptoms like feeling faint. **Yes, these symptoms could be indicative of something serious, and it's crucial that you see a doctor as soon as possible.**\\n\\nWhile I can't provide a diagnosis (as I am an AI and not a medical professional), I can tell you that the combination of persistent, overwhelming fatigue and feeling faint upon standing are symptoms that warrant medical attention.\\n\\nHere's why it's important to get checked out and some potential areas a doctor might explore:\\n\\n**Why You Need to See a Doctor:**\\n\\n*   **Persistent Fatigue:** While stress can cause fatigue, if it's been weeks and you're still feeling this way despite adequate sleep, it suggests an underlying issue beyond just temporary stress.\\n*   **Orthostatic Hypotension (Feeling Faint Upon Standing):** This is a significant symptom. It means your blood pressure drops when you change positions, leading to dizziness or feeling faint. This can be caused by various things, some of which need medical evaluation.\\n*   **Interconnected Symptoms:** The fatigue and the feeling of faintness could be related. For example, if your body isn't getting enough oxygen or your blood pressure is unstable, it can lead to both.\\n\\n**Potential Causes a Doctor Might Investigate (This is NOT a diagnosis, just possibilities):**\\n\\n*   **Anemia:** A deficiency in red blood cells or hemoglobin can lead to fatigue and dizziness because your body isn't getting enough oxygen. Iron deficiency anemia is common.\\n*   **Thyroid Problems:** Both an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) and an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) can cause significant fatigue.\\n*   **Dehydration:** Not drinking enough fluids can lead to low blood volume, which can cause dizziness and fatigue.\\n*   **Blood Sugar Issues:** Conditions like diabetes or hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) can manifest as fatigue and dizziness.\\n*   **Heart Conditions:** While less common, certain heart issues can cause fatigue and symptoms related to blood flow.\\n*   **Sleep Disorders:** Even if you're in bed for 9 hours, the quality of your sleep might be poor due to conditions like sleep apnea, which can leave you feeling exhausted.\\n*   **Medication Side Effects:** If you're taking any medications, they could be contributing to your symptoms.\\n*   **Infections:** Sometimes, lingering fatigue can be a sign of a past or ongoing infection.\\n*   **Nutrient Deficiencies:** Beyond iron, deficiencies in other vitamins and minerals (like Vitamin B12 or Vitamin D) can impact energy levels.\\n*   **Autonomic Nervous System Dysfunction:** This refers to problems with the part of your nervous system that controls involuntary functions like blood pressure and heart rate. Orthostatic hypotension can be a symptom of this.\\n\\n**What to Do Next:**\\n\\n1.  **Schedule an Appointment with Your Doctor Immediately:** Don't delay. Explain your symptoms clearly and emphasize how long they've been going on and how they're impacting your ability to function.\\n2.  **Be Prepared to Provide Information:**\\n    *   **When did the symptoms start?**\\n    *   **How severe is the fatigue on a scale of 1-10?**\\n    *   **How often do you feel faint when standing?**\\n    *   **Are there any other symptoms you're experiencing (e.g., headaches, shortness of breath, changes in appetite, weight changes, mood changes)?**\\n    *   **What is your typical diet like?**\\n    *   **How much water do you drink daily?**\\n    *   **What is your sleep routine?**\\n    *   **Are you taking any medications, supplements, or herbal remedies?**\\n    *   **Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions?**\\n    *   **Is there a family history of any relevant conditions (e.g., thyroid issues, heart problems, diabetes)?**\\n3.  **Don't Try to Self-Diagnose or Self-Treat:** While it's good to be informed, relying on online information can be misleading and delay proper medical care.\\n\\n**In the meantime, while you wait for your appointment:**\\n\\n*   **Stay Hydrated:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day.\\n*   **Eat Balanced Meals:** Focus on nutritious foods.\\n*   **Avoid Sudden Movements:** When standing up, do so slowly and deliberately. If you feel faint, sit or lie down immediately.\\n*   **Listen to Your Body:** Rest when you need to.\\n\\nPlease prioritize seeing a doctor. They are the only ones who can accurately assess your situation, perform necessary tests, and provide you with the right diagnosis and treatment plan. I hope you feel better soon!\",\n          \"It's completely understandable that you're concerned about your worsening joint pain, especially with the morning stiffness you're experiencing. Your symptoms \\u2013 pain and stiffness in your hands and wrists, particularly in the mornings, and occasional knee aches \\u2013 are indeed **highly suggestive of arthritis**.\\n\\nAt 45, you are in an age range where certain types of arthritis can begin to manifest or worsen.\\n\\nHere's a breakdown of why your symptoms point towards arthritis and what you should do next:\\n\\n**Why Your Symptoms Suggest Arthritis:**\\n\\n*   **Morning Stiffness:** This is a hallmark symptom of inflammatory arthritis, where inflammation builds up in the joints overnight. The stiffness typically improves with movement.\\n*   **Joint Pain:** Pain in the joints is a primary indicator of inflammation or wear and tear within the joint.\\n*   **Location:** Hands and wrists are very common sites for arthritis, especially osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Knee involvement is also frequent.\\n*   **Duration:** Three months of worsening symptoms is a significant period and warrants medical attention.\\n\\n**Possible Types of Arthritis to Consider (and why a doctor's diagnosis is crucial):**\\n\\nWhile I cannot diagnose you, here are some common types of arthritis that could be causing your symptoms:\\n\\n*   **Osteoarthritis (OA):** This is the most common type of arthritis. It's a degenerative condition where the cartilage that cushions the ends of your bones wears down over time. It often affects weight-bearing joints like the knees, but can also affect the hands and wrists. Pain and stiffness tend to worsen with activity and improve with rest, though morning stiffness can still occur.\\n*   **Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA):** This is an autoimmune disease where your immune system mistakenly attacks your own joint tissues, causing inflammation. RA often affects multiple joints symmetrically (e.g., both hands, both wrists). Morning stiffness is a prominent symptom and can last for hours. It can also affect other parts of the body.\\n*   **Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA):** This type of arthritis affects some people who have psoriasis, a skin condition. It can cause joint pain, stiffness, and swelling, and can affect various joints, including fingers, wrists, and knees.\\n*   **Gout:** While often associated with sudden, severe attacks in the big toe, gout can affect other joints and can cause chronic pain and inflammation.\\n*   **Other Inflammatory Arthropathies:** There are other less common inflammatory conditions that could be at play.\\n\\n**What You Should Do Next: See a Doctor!**\\n\\nThis is the most important step. You need to schedule an appointment with your primary care physician or a rheumatologist (a doctor specializing in arthritis and related conditions).\\n\\n**What to Expect at Your Doctor's Appointment:**\\n\\nYour doctor will likely:\\n\\n1.  **Take a Detailed Medical History:** They will ask you about:\\n    *   The exact location and nature of your pain (dull, sharp, aching, burning).\\n    *   When the pain and stiffness started and how they've progressed.\\n    *   What makes the pain better or worse.\\n    *   Any other symptoms you're experiencing (fatigue, skin changes, eye problems, etc.).\\n    *   Your family history of arthritis or autoimmune diseases.\\n    *   Your lifestyle, diet, and any medications you're taking.\\n2.  **Perform a Physical Examination:** They will examine your joints for:\\n    *   Swelling, redness, or warmth.\\n    *   Tenderness to touch.\\n    *   Range of motion and any limitations.\\n    *   Any deformities.\\n3.  **Order Diagnostic Tests:** These may include:\\n    *   **Blood Tests:** To check for inflammatory markers (like C-reactive protein or ESR), rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-CCP antibodies (specific for RA), and other indicators of autoimmune activity.\\n    *   **Imaging Tests:**\\n        *   **X-rays:** To look for signs of cartilage loss, bone spurs, or joint damage characteristic of osteoarthritis.\\n        *   **Ultrasound:** Can be helpful in visualizing soft tissues and early inflammation, especially in RA.\\n        *   **MRI:** May be used to get a more detailed view of the joints and surrounding tissues.\\n\\n**Why Early Diagnosis and Treatment are Important:**\\n\\n*   **Pain Management:** Getting a diagnosis allows for effective pain management strategies, which can significantly improve your quality of life.\\n*   **Preventing Joint Damage:** For inflammatory types of arthritis like RA, early treatment can help slow or even halt the progression of joint damage and prevent long-term disability.\\n*   **Improving Function:** With the right treatment, you can often regain or maintain the function of your hands and wrists, allowing you to continue with your daily activities.\\n\\n**In the meantime, while you wait for your appointment, you can consider:**\\n\\n*   **Gentle Movement:** While your joints are stiff, try to do some gentle range-of-motion exercises as soon as you can move them comfortably. This can help alleviate some of the stiffness.\\n*   **Warm Compresses:** Applying warm compresses or taking a warm shower in the morning might offer some temporary relief.\\n*   **Over-the-Counter Pain Relievers (with caution):** If the pain is significantly impacting you, you could consider over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. **However, it's crucial to discuss this with your doctor, especially if you have any other health conditions or are taking other medications.**\\n\\nPlease don't delay in seeking medical advice. Your symptoms are significant, and a proper diagnosis is the first step towards feeling better.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Evaluation\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1.Clinical Accuracy (20/20): The diagnosis of depression is highly plausible given the constellation of symptoms (persistent sadness, anhedonia, fatigue, poor concentration) and their duration.

Alignment with References (15/15): The response aligns well with the reference diagnosis by suggesting similar differential considerations such as anemia, thyroid problems, and autonomic nervous system dysfunction (which encompasses orthostatic intolerance). It correctly prioritizes seeing a doctor for comprehensive evaluation.\\n3. Groundedness in Input (15/15): The response directly addresses the patient's stated symptoms of \\\"insanely tired all the time\\\" and feeling like they are \\\"gonna faint\\\" when standing up. It acknowledges the duration (\\\"weeks\\\") and the lack of relief from sleep.\\n4. Use of Retrieved Evidence (0/10): The response does not include any specific biomedical evidence, quotations, or statistics from literature to support its claims. It lists potential causes but without referencing any supporting studies or data.\\n5. Transparency, Explainability & Informativeness (10/10): The response clearly explains why the symptoms are concerning, links potential causes to the symptoms, and provides a structured, actionable plan for the patient. It offers helpful context and prioritizes immediate medical attention.\\n6. Reasoning Quality (10/10): The reasoning is logical and consistent. It correctly connects the symptom of fatigue despite sleep to potential underlying issues and the symptom of feeling faint upon standing to orthostatic issues, and then explores common causes for both.\\n7. Clarity & Conciseness (10/10): The response is well-written, easy to follow, and avoids unnecessary jargon. It is polite, professional, and focuses on the critical information and actionable next steps without being overly verbose.\\n8. Disclaimer (10/10): The response includes a clear and comprehensive disclaimer stating that it is AI-generated, not a medical diagnosis, and that consultation with a healthcare provider is essential.\\n\\nTotal Score Calculation: 20+15+15+0+10+10+10+10 = 90\\nFinal Score: 90/100\",\n          \"1. Clinical Accuracy (20/20): The response accurately identifies arthritis as a highly plausible diagnosis given the patient's symptoms of worsening joint pain and morning stiffness in the hands, wrists, and knees. It correctly notes the patient's age as a relevant factor for certain types of arthritis.\\n\\n2. Alignment with References (15/15): The response aligns perfectly with the reference diagnosis, which strongly suggests early rheumatoid arthritis based on the described symptoms. It also correctly identifies the need for laboratory evaluation and referral to a rheumatologist.\\n\\n3. Groundedness in Input (15/15): The response directly addresses all aspects of the symptom description, including the duration (3 months), worsening nature, specific joints affected (hands, wrists, knees), and the key symptom of morning stiffness. No irrelevant information is introduced.\\n\\n4. Use of Retrieved Evidence (10/10): The response implicitly uses evidence by explaining the mechanisms behind morning stiffness in inflammatory arthritis and the typical presentation of OA and RA. While no direct citations are provided, the explanations are medically sound and reflect common clinical understanding derived from biomedical literature.\\n\\n5. Transparency, Explainability & Informativeness (10/10): The response clearly explains why the symptoms point towards arthritis, breaking down the significance of morning stiffness, joint pain, location, and duration. It provides a helpful list of possible arthritis types with brief explanations and outlines what to expect at a doctor's appointment, including diagnostic tests. The actionable next steps are prioritized.\\n\\n6. Reasoning Quality (10/10): The diagnostic reasoning is logical and consistent. It correctly links the patient's specific symptoms to the general characteristics of arthritis and then to specific types of arthritis, demonstrating a clear step-by-step thought process.\\n\\n7. Clarity & Conciseness (10/10): The response is well-written, easy to follow, and uses plain language. It avoids unnecessary verbosity and maintains a polite and professional tone. The information is presented in a continuous narrative, focusing on the most relevant aspects.\\n\\n8. Disclaimer (10/10): The response includes a clear and comprehensive disclaimer stating that it is AI-generated, not a medical diagnosis, and that consultation with a healthcare provider is essential.\\n\\nTotal Score Calculation: 20+15+15+10+10+10+10+10 = 100\\nFinal Score: 100/100\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Diagnosis_Score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 4,\n        \"min\": 86,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          97,\n          96,\n          86\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

            "Hello, thank you for sharing these details about your son's symptoms. It's understandable to be concerned when he's experiencing such significant nasal blockage, especially when it's affecting his sleep. Based on what you've described, including the constant nasal blockage for months and the recent findings of sinusitis and possible nasal polyps, a primary diagnostic hypothesis would be **chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps**. This condition is characterized by persistent inflammation in the nasal passages and sinuses, and nasal polyps are often a contributing factor.\n",
            "\n",
            "The duration of symptoms, described as \"constant nasal blockage for months,\" strongly suggests a chronic process rather than an acute infection. Medical literature generally recognizes that chronic rhinosinusitis is defined by sinonasal inflammation lasting at least 12 weeks, which aligns with your son's experience. Nasal polyps are benign growths that can cause significant nasal obstruction, as you've observed with your son's difficulty breathing and sleeping. The combination of chronic nasal blockage and the presence of nasal polyps is a well-established pattern in clinical practice. While other causes of nasal congestion exist, the persistent nature and the specific finding of polyps make chronic rhinosinusitis with polyps the most likely explanation at this time.\n",
            "\n",
            "Given these findings, the most appropriate next step would be to consult with an Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) specialist. An ENT doctor is the most qualified to thoroughly evaluate nasal polyps and chronic sinusitis. During your visit, the specialist will likely perform a detailed examination of your son's nasal passages, potentially using a small camera (nasal endoscopy), and may recommend imaging studies such as a CT scan of the sinuses to get a clearer picture of the extent of the inflammation and the polyps. Based on their findings, they can discuss treatment options, which might include nasal steroid sprays, saline rinses, or in some cases, medication to reduce inflammation or even surgical intervention to remove the polyps and improve drainage. In the meantime, ensuring your son gets adequate rest and stays well-hydrated are always good supportive measures.\n",
            "\n",
            "⚠️ Note, this is an AI-generated, evidence-guided clinical suggestion. It is **not a professional medical diagnosis** and should **never replace consultation with a licensed healthcare provider and medical care**. My goal is to support you with relevant information and guidance, but only a medical professional can provide a full evaluation.\n",

            "Given that he's been experiencing this for months and has a diagnosis of sinusitis, and the possibility of nasal polyps, **yes, absolutely, you should see an ENT (Ear, Nose, and Throat specialist).** This is the most appropriate next step.\n",

            "**Why an ENT is Essential:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Specialized Expertise:** ENTs are the experts in conditions affecting the ears, nose, and throat. They have the specific knowledge and tools to accurately diagnose and manage complex nasal and sinus issues.\n",
            "*   **Accurate Diagnosis:** While you've received a preliminary diagnosis, an ENT can confirm it and thoroughly investigate the underlying causes. This is especially important with potential nasal polyps, which require specialized evaluation.\n",
            "*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** An ENT will likely perform a more detailed examination, which might include:\n",
            "    *   **Nasal Endoscopy:** This is a key procedure where the ENT uses a thin, flexible tube with a camera (an endoscope) to look directly into your son's nasal passages and sinuses. This allows them to visualize the extent of inflammation, identify polyps, and assess for other abnormalities.\n",
            "    *   **Imaging:** They may order imaging tests like a CT scan of the sinuses. This provides detailed cross-sectional images of the sinuses, which is crucial for identifying the size and location of polyps, the degree of sinus inflammation, and any structural issues.\n",
            "    *   **Allergy Testing:** If allergies are suspected as a contributing factor to chronic sinusitis and polyps, the ENT may recommend allergy testing.\n",
            "*   **Personalized Treatment Plan:** Based on the diagnosis, the ENT will develop a tailored treatment plan for your son. This plan will aim to address the sinusitis and any polyps effectively.\n",
            "*   **Management of Sleep Issues:** The nasal blockage is clearly impacting his sleep. An ENT can provide solutions to improve his breathing and, consequently, his sleep quality.\n",
            "\n",
            "**What to Expect at the ENT Appointment:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Detailed History:** The ENT will ask you and your son detailed questions about his symptoms, how long they've been present, what makes them better or worse, any previous treatments, and his overall health.\n",
            "*   **Physical Examination:** This will include looking in his ears, nose, and throat.\n",
            "*   **Nasal Endoscopy:** As mentioned, this is a common and important part of the evaluation.\n",
            "*   **Discussion of Findings and Treatment Options:** The ENT will explain their findings and discuss the best course of action. Treatment options can vary widely and may include:\n",
            "    *   **Medications:** Nasal steroid sprays are often the first line of treatment for sinusitis and polyps to reduce inflammation. Other medications like antibiotics (if a bacterial infection is present) or oral steroids might be considered.\n",
            "    *   **Allergy Management:** If allergies are a factor, they will discuss strategies for managing them.\n",
            "    *   **Surgery:** If medications are not effective or if the polyps are large and significantly obstructing his airways, surgery might be recommended. This could involve procedures to remove the polyps and open up the sinus passages.\n",
            "\n",
            "**In the meantime, while you wait for your ENT appointment:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Saline Nasal Rinses:** You can continue with saline nasal rinses (using a neti pot or saline spray) as this can help clear out mucus and reduce inflammation. Make sure to use distilled, sterile, or previously boiled water.\n",
            "*   **Humidifier:** Using a humidifier in his bedroom at night can help keep his nasal passages moist and potentially ease congestion.\n",
            "*   **Elevate His Head:** Encourage him to sleep with his head slightly elevated on an extra pillow. This can help with drainage and make breathing easier.\n",
            "*   **Avoid Irritants:** Try to identify and avoid any potential triggers like smoke, strong perfumes, or dust.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Don't delay in scheduling that ENT appointment.** The sooner you get a specialist involved, the sooner your son can get relief from his symptoms and improve his quality of life, especially his sleep.\n",

            "Hello, thank you for sharing these details about your son's symptoms. It sounds like a challenging situation, especially with his sleep being affected. Based on what you've described, including persistent nasal blockage for months and the recent findings of sinusitis and possibly nasal polyps, the most likely explanation points towards **chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps**. This condition is characterized by long-standing inflammation in the nasal passages and sinuses, and nasal polyps are often a feature of this.\n",
            "\n",
            "The persistent nasal blockage for months is a key indicator of a chronic process, aligning with the definition of chronic rhinosinusitis, which medical literature defines as persistent sinonasal inflammation lasting at least 12 weeks. The presence of nasal polyps, described as benign growths of the sinonasal lining, directly explains the significant nasal obstruction and difficulty breathing, which in turn is causing his sleep disturbance. These symptoms – nasal congestion and sleep disturbance – are also recognized as common co-occurrences in the structured clinical knowledge available for these conditions. While other causes of nasal congestion exist, the duration and the specific mention of polyps strongly suggest this diagnosis.\n",
            "\n",
            "Given these findings, consulting with an Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) specialist is indeed the most appropriate next step. An ENT can perform a thorough examination, which may include nasal endoscopy, to visualize the extent of the polyps and inflammation. They can then discuss treatment options, which might range from medical management with nasal steroids and saline rinses to surgical intervention if the polyps are significantly impacting his quality of life and breathing. In the meantime, ensuring he maintains good hydration and uses a saline nasal spray as directed by a healthcare provider could offer some temporary relief for the congestion.\n",

            "⚠️ Note, this is an AI-generated, evidence-guided clinical suggestion. It is **not a professional medical diagnosis** and should **never replace consultation with a licensed healthcare provider and medical care**. My goal is to support you with relevant information and guidance, but only a medical professional can provide a full evaluation.\n",
