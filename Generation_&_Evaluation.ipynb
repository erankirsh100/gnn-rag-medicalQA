        "- Informative, but not overwhelming — prioritize clarity and helpfulness over medical verbosity.\n",
        "- Responsible — never provide false reassurance or definitive answers when the situation is uncertain or potentially serious.\n",
        "- Balanced and calm — do not use language that is alarming or anxiety-provoking (e.g., “this could be deadly”) unless medically necessary. Instead, say things like “this may indicate a condition that requires urgent evaluation.”\n",
        "- Supportive, not dismissive — even if the symptoms appear mild, avoid brushing them off. Acknowledge them and offer realistic, medically informed next steps.\n",

Additionally, the structured GNN knowledge graph highlights frequent co-occurrence of these symptoms with iron deficiency in both general and gender-specific populations. No conflicting diagnoses were strongly supported by the RAG evidence.\n",

In the meantime, monitoring energy levels, heart rate, and breathing during mild activity may offer helpful insights. If symptoms worsen (especially increased heart rate, chest discomfort, or dizziness), more urgent evaluation may be necessary.\n",
